    <book_description><![CDATA[ Todos aspiramos a construir nuestro propio patrimonio y a generar rentas pasivas. No obstante, no es fácil conseguirlo sin una idea clara de qué, cómo y cuándo debe hacerse. Sin los conocimientos adecuados estamos abocados a cometer errores que pongan en riesgo nuestras inversiones y, aun peor, nuestros ahorros. <br /><br /> En este libro, que recoge las exitosas lecciones del veterano inversor y profesor Juan Haro, conoceremos los trucos para adquirir inmuebles baratos que nos proporcionen unas rentas constantes. Es lo que hacen los ricos. Pero, ¿cómo compran ellos las propiedades? ¿Qué sistemas utilizan? Esto es lo que descubriremos aquí. Porque si ellos pueden, tú también. <br /><br /> El inmobiliario es un sector atractivo para las grandes fortunas porque se trata de un activo patrimonialista. Pero el pequeño inversor también puede canalizar sus inversiones hacia él y generar así sus propias rentas. Ahora, está en tu mano saber cómo se hace y alcanzar el nivel de vida, y la sensación de libertad, que todos anhelamos. ]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<p>The world has changed forever. <br /></p> 
   Governments have expanded their reach over their citizens’ lives, <br /> 
   Power is being consolidated by an elite few, and <br /> 
   The world economy has become more volatile and unpredictable.  
 <p>Meanwhile, the internet, a globalizing world economy, and the emergence of the developing world present opportunities to anyone willing to make simple changes to their life. </p><p>Geography is no longer a limitation for those willing to follow Andrew Henderson’s ‘Five Magic Words’ and <strong>“Go where you’re treated best.” </strong></p><p>As the world’s most sought-after expert on offshore tax planning, second passports, and global citizenship - cited by the BBC, Bloomberg, Elite Daily and more - Andrew has condensed his last ten years of investigative world travel into an unprecedented book to help entrepreneurs and investors keep more of their own money, live where they want, become citizens of the world, and improve their lives and the planet. </p><p>Direct. Honest. Experienced. Unapologetic. Practical. Transparent. Even funny. The Nomad Capitalist will show you how to take his “E-K-G” formula to:<br /></p> 
    ENHANCE your personal lifestyle, <br /> 
   KEEP more of your money, and <br /> 
   GROW your money by living, investing, banking, and doing business overseas.  
 <p>From foreign companies to offshore accounts and from overseas investments to dual citizenship, you’ll find everything you need to know to begin a life of international proportions, storing gold in super-secret vaults, finding love in exotic locations, and improving everything from your health to your tax bill by simply “going where you’re treated best.” </p><p>It is no longer enough to be a digital nomad. Those who want complete freedom from the world’s broken systems <strong>must become Nomad Capitalists</strong>, learning to navigate the world system to reclaim their freedom and rediscover the possibilities of capitalism’s greatest promises.</p><p>Get the book to see how.</p>]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[It is worse, much worse, than you think. If your anxiety about global warming is dominated by fears of sea-level rise, you are barely scratching the surface of what terrors are possible. In California, wildfires now rage year-round, destroying thousands of homes. Across the US, "500-year" storms pummel communities month after month, and floods displace tens of millions annually.<br /><br />This is only a preview of the changes to come. And they are coming fast. Without a revolution in how billions of humans conduct their lives, parts of the Earth could become close to uninhabitable, and other parts horrifically inhospitable, as soon as the end of this century.<br /><br />In his travelogue of our near future, David Wallace-Wells brings into stark relief the climate troubles that await--food shortages, refugee emergencies, and other crises that will reshape the globe. But the world will be remade by warming in more profound ways as well, transforming our politics, our culture, our relationship to technology, and our sense of history. It will be all-encompassing, shaping and distorting nearly every aspect of human life as it is lived today.<br /><br />Like <i>An Inconvenient Truth</i> and <i>Silent Spring</i> before it, <i>The Uninhabitable Earth</i> is both a meditation on the devastation we have brought upon ourselves and an impassioned call to action. For just as the world was brought to the brink of catastrophe within the span of a lifetime, the responsibility to avoid it now belongs to a single generation.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[El camino a la libertad financiera. Ser imbatible es una cuestión de dinero. Saber que, pase lo que pase en la economía, la bolsa o el mercado inmobiliario, tú vas a seguir teniendo seguridad financiera, podrás atender tus necesidades y las de tu familia, y sentirás el placer, la tranquilidad y la felicidad que eso conlleva. Pero también es algo más. Es sentirse seguro en mitad de una tormenta. Es no dejar que el miedo se apodere de ti. ¿Significa eso que no tienes malos momentos o que nunca te vienes abajo? No. Significa que si caes, te pones de pie enseguida. Que si algo te preocupa, lo hace durante poco tiempo. Que eres libre para ser un líder que toma decisiones y se aprovecha de la confusión mientras los demás, asustados, se limitan a hablar en lugar de actuar. Imbatible es un manual para alcanzar ese deseable estado mental. Un viaje para transformar tu vida financiera y acelerar tu camino hacia una estabilidad que es sinónimo de libertad. No importa cuánto ganas, en qué trabajas o dónde empezaste. Este libro te da las herramientas que te ayudarán a alcanzar tus objetivos financieros con una rapidez que no creías posible. Si existiese un premio Pulitzer de libros de inversión, este libro lo ganaría sin lugar a dudas. ― Steve Forbes, editor y consejero delegado de Forbes En este libro, Robbins emplea su inmenso talento en hacer sencillo lo complejo, y convierte los conceptos de los mejores inversores del mundo en lecciones prácticas que beneﬁciarán tanto a los inversores aﬁcionados como a los profesionales con experiencia. ― Ray Dalio, fundador y codirector de inversiones de Bridgewater Associates, el mayor fondo de inversión de alto riesgo del mundo.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<b>Want to change your life? Then change your <i>mind.</i></b><br /><br />In <b>
  <i>The Art of Success,</i>
</b> James Melouney invites you to see the world differently—by walking in the shoes of 134 extraordinarily successful people. These billionaires and business gurus; sports stars and rock stars; philosophers, emperors, inventors, and saints have lived exceptional lives. So what, exactly, do they know that you don’t?<br /><br />Einstein, Edison, Jobs, and all the others are in these pages for one reason: to reveal the crucial lessons that helped them turn their dreams into reality. And the best part is, <i>anyone can learn them!</i><br /><br />It doesn’t matter where you come from or what mistakes you’ve made. In fact, humble origins, false starts, and even outright failure can be your biggest assets. What matters is your choice in this moment. Don’t wait.<br /><br /><b>Will you remember today?</b><br /><br />We are all unique, but as different as we all are, the things we seek in life are astonishingly similar. We <i>all</i> want happiness, fulfillment, health, and financial security. But it seems that only a small group of people are able to achieve what they truly desire in life.<br /><br />So why do some people live exceptional lives, while others seemingly trudge along, never amounting to their true potential and never living the life they know they are capable of? This question has been asked throughout history, but of all the factors that influence our lives, it comes down to one: <i>philosophy.</i> And all it takes is a few words to <b>forever</b> change the way you see the world.<br /><br />If you are curious to learn a philosophy that can momentously affect your life, these pages hold some of the best there is. With 134 inspiring exemplars waiting to share their ideas with you, many of the answers you seek are within your reach.<br /><br />"<i>
  <b>The Art of Success</b>
</i> is like having a coffee with the world's greatest business minds. Melouney has collected some of the most profound quotes on success and infused them with a caffeinated text that will leave you energized to take on the world." —<b>Jay Samit, bestselling author of <i>Disrupt You!</i></b><br /><br />"I write this review as the 2016 Rio Olympics come to a close. I’m reminded of the similarities between a good athlete and a good writer: inherent skill, internalized motivation, years of intense work, overcoming countless hurdles, artful negotiation of the unexpected, then the finish line. James has succeeded. I’d award him a gold medal for <i>
  <b>The Art of Success.</b>
</i>" —<b>Paul W. Swets, bestselling author of <i>The Art of Talking So That People Will Listen</i></b><br /><br />Most people won't take the time or invest the money to grow and develop themselves. The question is, what does doing nothing cost you?]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[At the dawn of the next world war, a plane crashes on an uncharted island, stranding a group of schoolboys. At first, with no adult supervision, their freedom is something to celebrate; this far from civilization the boys can do anything they want. Anything. They attempt to forge their own society, failing, however, in the face of terror, sin and evil. And as order collapses, as strange howls echo in the night, as terror begins its reign, the hope of adventure seems as far from reality as the hope of being rescued. Labeled a parable, an allegory, a myth, a morality tale, a parody, a political treatise, even a vision of the apocalypse, Lord of the Flies is perhaps our most memorable novel about “the end of innocence, the darkness of man’s heart.”]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[The Two Towers. Book Two in J.R.R. Tolkien's acclaimed trilogy, a masterpiece of high fantasy. <br /><br />Frodo and his Companions of the Ring have been beset by danger during their quest to prevent the Ruling Ring from falling into the hands of the Dark Lord by destroying it in the Cracks of Doom. They have lost the wizard, Gandalf, in a battle in the Mines of Moria. And Boromir, seduced by the power of the Ring, tried to seize it by force. While Frodo and Sam made their escape, the rest of the company was attacked by Orcs. <br /><br />Now they continue the journey alone down the great River Anduin -- alone, that is, save for the mysterious creeping figure that follows wherever they go.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<i>'Three bicycles. Seven ghosts. A crumbling apartment block on the hill. Fame. Tenderness. The statue of Peter Pan. Silk. Melancholy. The banana tree. A Pandemic. A love story.'</i><br /><br />From one of the great thinkers and writers of our time, comes the highly anticipated final installment in Deborah Levy's critically acclaimed 'Living Autobiography'<br /><br />'I can't think of any writer aside from Virginia Woolf who writes better about what it is to be a woman' <i>Observer </i>on<i> The Cost of Living</i><br /><br />Following the international critical acclaim of <i>The Cost of Living</i>, this final volume of Deborah Levy's 'Living Autobiography' is an exhilarating, thought-provoking and boldly intimate meditation on home and the spectres that haunt it.<br /><br /><i>'I began to wonder what myself and all unwritten and unseen women would possess in their property portfolios at the end of their lives. Literally, her physical property and possessions, and then everything else she valued, though it might not be valued by society. What might she claim, own, discard and bequeath? Or is she the real estate, owned by patriarchy? In this sense, Real Estate is a tricky business. We rent it and buy it, sell and inherit it - but we must also knock it down.' </i><br /><br />'Wise, subtle and ironic, Levy's every sentence is a masterpiece of clarity and poise... A brilliant writer' <i>Daily Telegraph </i>on<i> The Cost of Living</i><br /><br />'Extraordinary and beautiful, suffused with wit and razor-sharp insights' <i>Financial Times </i>on<i> The Cost of Living</i>]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Intention is generally viewed as a pit-bull kind of determination propelling one to succeed at all costs by never giving up on an inner picture. In this view, an attitude that combines hard work with an indefatigable drive toward excellence is the way to succeed. However, intention is viewed very differently in this book. <b>Dr. Wayne W. Dyer </b>has researched intention as a force in the universe that <i>allows</i> the act of creation to take place. This book explores intention—not as something you do—but as an energy you’re a part of. We’re all <i>intended</i> here through the invisible power of intention. This is the first book to look at intention as a field of energy that you can access to begin co-creating your life with the power of intention.<br /> <br />Part I deals with the principles of intention, offering true stories and examples on ways to make the connection. Dr. Dyer identifies the attributes of the all-creating universal mind of intention as creative, kind, loving, beautiful, expanding, endlessly abundant, and receptive, explaining the importance of emulating this source of creativity. In Part II, Dr. Dyer offers an intention guide with specific ways to apply the co-creating principles in daily life. Part III is an exhilarating description of Dr. Dyer’s vision of a world in harmony with the universal mind of intention.<br /> ]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<b>The acclaimed <i>New York Times </i>and <i>Wall Street Journal</i> bestseller from Robert Cialdini—“the foremost expert on effective persuasion” (<i>Harvard Business Review</i>)—explains how it’s not necessarily the message itself that changes minds, but the key moment <i>before</i> you deliver that message.</b><br /><br />What separates effective communicators from truly successful persuaders? With the same rigorous scientific research and accessibility that made his <i>Influence</i> an iconic bestseller, Robert Cialdini explains how to prepare people to be receptive to a message before they experience it. Optimal persuasion is achieved only through optimal <i>pre</i>-suasion. In other words, to change “minds” a pre-suader must also change “states of mind.”<br /> <br />Named a “Best Business Books of 2016” by the <i>Financial Times</i>, and “compelling” by <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>, Cialdini’s <i>Pre-Suasion</i> draws on his extensive experience as the most cited social psychologist of our time and explains the techniques a person should implement to become a master persuader. Altering a listener’s attitudes, beliefs, or experiences isn’t necessary, says Cialdini—all that’s required is for a communicator to redirect the audience’s focus of attention before a relevant action.<br /> <br />From studies on advertising imagery to treating opiate addiction, from the annual letters of Berkshire Hathaway to the annals of history, Cialdini outlines the specific techniques you can use on online marketing campaigns and even effective wartime propaganda. He illustrates how the artful diversion of attention leads to successful pre-suasion and gets your targeted audience primed and ready to say, “Yes.” His book is “an essential tool for anyone serious about science based business strategies…and is destined to be an instant classic. It belongs on the shelf of anyone in business, from the CEO to the newest salesperson” (<i>Forbes</i>).]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Pluriverso: Un diccionario del posdesarrollo es una estimulante colección de más de 100 ensayos sobre alternativas transformadoras a los actuales procesos dominantes del desarrollo globalizado, incluidas sus raíces estructurales ancladas en los valores de la modernidad, el capitalismo, el dominio estatal y lo masculino. En el imaginario posdesarrollista, el «desarrollo» ya no sería el principio organizador de la vida social. El libro presenta cosmovisiones y prácticas de todo el mundo en una búsqueda colectiva de sociedades ecológicamente sabias y socialmente justas. También ofrece ensayos críticos sobre una serie de falsas soluciones que quienes detentan el poder están proponiendo, en un intento de «ecologizar» el desarrollo. Entre los más de 120 coautores del volumen encontramos activistas, académicos y profesionales con una vasta experiencia en sus respectivas áreas de investigación.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[We need to break free from the capitalist economy. Degrowth gives us the tools to bend its bars. Economic growth isn’t working, and it cannot be made to work. Offering a counter-history of how economic growth emerged in the context of colonialism, fossil-fueled industrialization, and capitalist modernity, The Future Is Degrowth argues that the ideology of growth conceals the rising inequalities and ecological destructions associated with capitalism, and points to desirable alternatives to it. Not only in society at large, but also on the left, we are held captive by the hegemony of growth. Even proposals for emancipatory Green New Deals or postcapitalism base their utopian hopes on the development of productive forces, on redistributing the fruits of economic growth and technological progress. Yet growing evidence shows that continued economic growth cannot be made compatible with sustaining life and is not necessary for a good life for all. This book provides a vision for postcapitalism beyond growth. Building on a vibrant field of research, it discusses the political economy and the politics of a non-growing economy. It charts a path forward through policies that democratise the economy, “now-topias” that create free spaces for experimentation, and counter-hegemonic movements that make it possible to break with the logic of growth. Degrowth perspectives offer a way to step off the treadmill of an alienating, expansionist, and hierarchical system. A handbook and a manifesto, The Future Is Degrowth is a must-read for all interested in charting a way beyond the current crises.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[From the physician behind the wildly popular website NutritionFacts.org, <i>How Not to Die </i>reveals the groundbreaking scientific evidence behind the only diet that can prevent and reverse many of the causes of disease-related death.<br /><br />The vast majority of premature deaths can be prevented through simple changes in diet and lifestyle. In <i>How Not to Die</i>, Dr. Michael Greger, the internationally-renowned nutrition expert, physician, and founder of NutritionFacts.org, examines the fifteen top causes of premature death in America -- heart disease, various cancers, diabetes, Parkinson's, high blood pressure, and more -- and explains how nutritional and lifestyle interventions can sometimes trump prescription pills and other pharmaceutical and surgical approaches, freeing us to live healthier lives.<br /><br />The simple truth is that most doctors are good at treating acute illnesses but bad at preventing chronic disease. The fifteen leading causes of death claim the lives of 1.6 million Americans annually. This doesn't have to be the case. By following Dr. Greger's advice, all of it backed up by strong scientific evidence, you will learn which foods to eat and which lifestyle changes to make to live longer.<br /><br />History of prostate cancer in your family? Put down that glass of milk and add flaxseed to your diet whenever you can. Have high blood pressure? Hibiscus tea can work better than a leading hypertensive drug-and without the side effects. Fighting off liver disease? Drinking coffee can reduce liver inflammation. Battling breast cancer? Consuming soy is associated with prolonged survival. Worried about heart disease (the number 1 killer in the United States)? Switch to a whole-food, plant-based diet, which has been repeatedly shown not just to prevent the disease but often stop it in its tracks.<br /><br />In addition to showing what to eat to help treat the top fifteen causes of death, <i>How Not to Die</i> includes Dr. Greger's Daily Dozen -- a checklist of the twelve foods we should consume every day. Full of practical, actionable advice and surprising, cutting edge nutritional science, these doctor's orders are just what we need to live longer, healthier lives.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[The season's most talked-about all-purpose personal strategy guide and philosophical compendium," said Newsweek of <b>Robert Greene's</b> bold, elegant, and ingenious manual of modern manipulation, <i>The 48 Laws of Power</i>. Now Greene has once again mined history and literature to distill the essence of seduction, the most highly refined mode of influence, the ultimate power trip.<br /><br /> <i>The Art of Seduction</i> is a masterful synthesis of the work of thinkers such as Freud, Ovid, Kierkegaard, and Einstein, as well as the achievements of the greatest seducers throughout history. From Cleopatra to John F. Kennedy, from Andy Warhol to Josephine Bonaparte, <i>The Art of Seduction</i> gets to the heart of the character of the seducer and his or her tactics, triumphs and failures. The seducer's many faces include: the Siren, the Rake, the Ideal Lover, the Dandy, the Natural, the Coquette, the Charmer, and the Charismatic. Twenty-four maneuvers will guide readers through the seduction process, providing cunning, amoral instructions for and analysis of this fascinating, all-pervasive form of power. Just as beautifully packaged and every bit as essential as <i>The 48 Laws of Power</i>, <i>The Art of Seduction</i> is an indispensable primer of persuasion and offers the best lessons on how to take what you want from whomever you want or how to prevent yourself from being taken.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Among the seminal texts of the 20th century, <i>Nineteen Eighty-Four</i> is a rare work that grows more haunting as its futuristic purgatory becomes more real. Published in 1949, the book offers political satirist George Orwell's nightmarish vision of a totalitarian, bureaucratic world and one poor stiff's attempt to find individuality. The brilliance of the novel is Orwell's prescience of modern life—the ubiquity of television, the distortion of the language—and his ability to construct such a thorough version of hell. Required reading for students since it was published, it ranks among the most terrifying novels ever written.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Think and Grow Rich is a guide to success by Napoleon Hill, which was first published in 1937 following the Great Depression. It was immediately welcomed as an antidote to hard times and remained a bestseller for decades. Many people still find its philosophy of positive thinking and its specific steps for achieving wealth both relevant and life-changing. Hill contends that our thoughts become our reality, and offers a plan and principles for transforming thoughts into riches, including visualization, affirmation, creating a Master Mind group, defining a goal, and planning.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<b>Learn what sets high achievers apart — from Bill Gates to the Beatles — in this #1 bestseller from "a singular talent" (<i>New York Times Book Review</i>).</b><br /><br />In this stunning book, Malcolm Gladwell takes us on an intellectual journey through the world of "outliers"—the best and the brightest, the most famous and the most successful. He asks the question: what makes high-achievers different?<br /><br />His answer is that we pay too much attention to what successful people are like, and too little attention to where they are from: that is, their culture, their family, their generation, and the idiosyncratic experiences of their upbringing. Along the way he explains the secrets of software billionaires, what it takes to be a great soccer player, why Asians are good at math, and what made the Beatles the greatest rock band.<br /><br />Brilliant and entertaining, <i>Outliers</i> is a landmark work that will simultaneously delight and illuminate.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's investigations of "optimal experience" have revealed that what makes an experience genuinely satisfying is a state of consciousness called flow. During flow, people typically experience deep enjoyment, creativity, and a total involvement with life. Csikszentmihalyi demonstrates the ways this positive state can be controlled, not just left to chance. Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience teaches how, by ordering the information that enters our consciousness, we can discover true happiness, unlock our potential, and greatly improve the quality of our lives.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[The groundbreaking book that redefines what it means to be smart, with a new introduction by the author.<br /><br />Everyone knows that high IQ is no guarantee of success, happiness, or virtue, but until Emotional Intelligence, we could only guess why. Daniel Goleman's brilliant report from the frontiers of psychology and neuroscience offers startling new insight into our “two minds”—the rational and the emotional—and how they together shape our destiny.<br /><br />Drawing on groundbreaking brain and behavioral research, Goleman shows the factors at work when people of high IQ flounder and those of modest IQ do surprisingly well. These factors, which include self-awareness, self-discipline, and empathy, add up to a different way of being smart—and they aren’t fixed at birth. Although shaped by childhood experiences, emotional intelligence can be nurtured and strengthened throughout our adulthood—with immediate benefits to our health, our relationships, and our work. <br /> <br />The twenty-fifth-anniversary edition of Emotional Intelligence could not come at a better time—we spend so much of our time online, more and more jobs are becoming automated and digitized, and our children are picking up new technology faster than we ever imagined. With a new introduction from the author, the twenty-fifth-anniversary edition prepares readers, now more than ever, to reach their fullest potential and stand out from the pack with the help of EI.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<b>Malcolm Gladwell, host of the podcast Revisionist History and author of the #1 New York Times bestseller <i>Outliers</i>, offers a powerful examination of our interactions with strangers -- and why they often go wrong.</b><br /><br />How did Fidel Castro fool the CIA for a generation? Why did Neville Chamberlain think he could trust Adolf Hitler? Why are campus sexual assaults on the rise? Do television sitcoms teach us something about the way we relate to each other that isn't true?<br /><br />While tackling these questions, Malcolm Gladwell was not solely writing a book for the page. He was also producing for the ear. In the audiobook version of Talking to Strangers, you'll hear the voices of people he interviewed--scientists, criminologists, military psychologists. Court transcripts are brought to life with re-enactments. You actually hear the contentious arrest of Sandra Bland by the side of the road in Texas. As Gladwell revisits the deceptions of Bernie Madoff, the trial of Amanda Knox, and the suicide of Sylvia Plath, you hear directly from many of the players in these real-life tragedies. There's even a theme song - Janelle Monae's "Hell You Talmbout."<br /><br />Something is very wrong, Gladwell argues, with the tools and strategies we use to make sense of people we don't know. And because we don't know how to talk to strangers, we are inviting conflict and misunderstanding in ways that have a profound effect on our lives and our world.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<div>As featured in the bestselling book <i>The Secret</i>, here is the landmark guide to wealth creation republished with the classic essay “How to Get What You Want.” Wallace D. Wattles spent a lifetime considering the laws of success as he found them in the work of the world’s great philosophers. He then turned his life effort into this simple, slender book – a volume that he vowed could replace libraries of philosophy, spirituality, and self-help for the purpose of attaining one definite goal: a life of prosperity. Wattles describes a definite science of wealth attraction, built on the foundation of one commanding idea: “There is a thinking stuff from which all things are madeâ€¦A thought, in this substance, produces the thing that is imaged by the thought.” In his seventeen short, straight-to-the-point chapters, Wattles shows how to <b><i>use</i></b> this idea, how to <b><i>overcome</i></b> barriers to its application, and how work with very direct <b><i>methods</i></b> that awaken it in your life. He further explains how <b><i>creation and not competition</i></b> is the hidden key to wealth attraction, and how your power to get rich uplifts everyone around you. <i>The Science of Getting Rich</i> concludes with Wattle’s rare essay “How to Get Want You Want” – a brilliant refresher of his laws of wealth creation. </div>]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[“There are a few investment managers, of course, who are very good – though in the short run, it’s difficult to determine whether a great record is due to luck or talent. Most advisors, however, are far better at generating high fees than they are at generating high returns. In truth, their core competence is salesmanship. Rather than listen to their siren songs, investors – large and small – should instead read Jack Bogle’s The Little Book of Common Sense Investing .” – Warren Buffett, Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, 2014 Annual Shareholder Letter. Investing is all about common sense. Owning a diversified portfolio of stocks and holding it for the long term is a winner’s game. Trying to beat the stock market is theoretically a zero-sum game (for every winner, there must be a loser), but after the substantial costs of investing are deducted, it becomes a loser’s game. Common sense tells us—and history confirms—that the simplest and most efficient investment strategy is to buy and hold all of the nation’s publicly held businesses at very low cost. The classic index fund that owns this market portfolio is the only investment that guarantees you with your fair share of stock market returns. To learn how to make index investing work for you, there’s no better mentor than legendary mutual fund industry veteran John C. Bogle. Over the course of his long career, Bogle—founder of the Vanguard Group and creator of the world’s first index mutual fund—has relied primarily on index investing to help Vanguard’s clients build substantial wealth. Now, with The Little Book of Common Sense Investing, he wants to help you do the same. Filled with in-depth insights and practical advice, The Little Book of Common Sense Investing will show you how to incorporate this proven investment strategy into your portfolio. It will also change the very way you think about investing. Successful investing is not easy. (It requires discipline and patience.) But it is simple. For it’s all about common sense. With The Little Book of Common Sense Investing as your guide, you’ll discover how to make investing a winner’s game: You’ll also find warnings about investment fads and fashions, including the recent stampede into exchange traded funds and the rise of indexing gimmickry. The real formula for investment success is to own the entire market, while significantly minimizing the costs of financial intermediation. That’s what index investing is all about. And that’s what this book is all about.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<b>The Barnes &amp; Noble Review</b><br /> Who <i>is</i> the average millionaire? Does he eat gourmet or fast food? Does he drive fancy cars, take chic vacations, and indulge wherever and whenever he can? Or does he resole his shoes, turn off the air conditioning when he leaves the house, and spend a lot of time at home with close friends and family? Through his surveys of over 1,000 millionaires, Thomas J. Stanley, Ph.D., answers these questions and provides us with further insight into the thoughts and lives of this wealthy segment of the population in <i>The Millionaire Mind</i>. <p> A follow-up to Stanley's <i>New York Times</i> bestseller, <i>The Millionaire Next Door</i>, <i>The Millionaire Mind</i> may surprise readers with its findings about the kinds of people that millionaires really are. Interestingly, many millionaires were not straight-A students in high school, nor did they attend prestigious colleges. Instead, they were often told when they were younger that they were <i>not</i> bright and that they would <i>not</i> be successful. These challenges taught them how to surmount obstacles and motivated them to try harder and to take risks to get ahead financially. </p><p> The major risks that these millionaires have taken and continue to take are financial ones. They must overcome the fear of taking risks, and they must maintain this courage throughout their adult careers. Stanley discovered that many millionaires share similarities in techniques to allay their anxieties and stay on track financially. Some of these include:</p>   Believing in myself   Counting my blessings every day   Countering negativethoughtswith positive ones   Sharing concerns with spouse   Visualizing success   Outworking, outthinking, out-toughing the competition   Hiring talented advisors   Constantly upgrading my knowledge about my occupation   Spending considerable time planning my success   Exercising regularly   Having strong religious faith <p> Stanley also reveals that millionaires are very often successful in marriage as well as in work (the typical millionaire has been married to the same spouse for over twenty-five years) and that they usually lead relatively frugal, economically productive lifestyles. Perhaps most interesting to readers will be the section that Stanley devotes to how millionaires chose the career in which they would be most likely to succeed. </p><p> So don't miss out on picking apart and analyzing the thoughts and habits of millionaires with Thomas Stanley and <i>The Millionaire Mind</i>, a book sure to be as brilliantly revealing and fascinating as his previous bestseller on millionaires. </p><p>Thomas J. Stanley, Ph.D., is a researcher, author, and lecturer. He has studied the wealthy for more than 25 years. <i>The Millionaire Next Door</i>, published in 1996, has sold more than one million copies in hardcover and nearly one million in paperback. The book has been on <i>The New York Times</i> Best Sellers list for more than 150 combined weeks. </p><p> His previous books include <i>Marketing to the Affluent</i>, which <i>Best of Business Quarterly</i> named one of 10 outstanding business books, <i>Selling to the Affluent</i>, and <i>Networking with the Affluent</i>. </p><p> Dr. Stanley lives in Atlanta. He was a professor of marketing at Georgia State University, where he was named Omicron Delta Kappa Outstanding Professor. He holds his doctorate from the University of Georgia in Athens.</p>  ]]></book_description>

Once you understand this basic principle, you no longer need to be afraid of the tax laws. They are there to help you and your business—not to hinder you.<br /><br />Once you understand the basic principles of tax reduction, you can begin, immediately, reducing your taxes. Eventually, you may even be able to legally eliminate your income taxes and drastically reduce your other taxes. Once you do that, you can live a life of Tax-Free Wealth.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Discover why the world's leading Sustainable and Responsible investors choose to invest for good - while making market returns.<br /><br />Sustainable &amp; Responsible Investing 360° is a compelling read for anyone interested in pursuing an investment strategy for positive social, environmental, and ethical impact – at market rate returns. With climate change, social justice, and political divisions at the forefront of today’s headlines, the stories and tactics of Sustainable and Responsible Investing have become not only mainstream but exceptionally relevant to the next generation of investors.<br /><br />Recognizing the powerful impact that Sustainable and Responsible investing can have on these societal, economic, and environmental challenges, Scott Arnell has identified and connected with 26 of the world’s leading Sustainable and Responsible Investment experts, engaging in comprehensive conversations to reveal their unique investment journeys, approaches, experiences, tips, strategies, and insights.<br /><br />Arnell’s interviewees have more than 700 years of combined professional investment experience with trillions in assets under management. Somewhere along their professional journey, each made a personal and professional commitment to use investing as a proactive force for good. Now they reap not just financial rewards but gain profound satisfaction knowing that they are helping improve the world and the lives of those in it. “My goal in researching and writing this book,” Arnell explains, “was to reveal how these experts integrate non-financial criteria into their investment decisions to successfully achieve environmental and social impact in the world alongside market-rate financial returns. I also wanted readers to understand how the individual life voyages of these leading investors led them to commit to engaging exclusively in Sustainable and Responsible investing, hopefully inspiring others to reflect on their own investing philosophies.”]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Andrew Ross Sorkin delivers the first true behind-the-scenes, moment-by-moment account of how the greatest financial crisis since the Great Depression developed into a global tsunami. From inside the corner office at Lehman Brothers to secret meetings in South Korea, and the corridors of Washington, <i>Too Big to Fail</i> is the definitive story of the most powerful men and women in finance and politics grappling with success and failure, ego and greed, and, ultimately, the fate of the world’s economy.<br /><br /> “We’ve got to get some foam down on the runway!” a sleepless Timothy Geithner, the then-president of the Federal Reserve of New York, would tell Henry M. Paulson, the Treasury secretary, about the catastrophic crash the world’s financial system would experience.<br /><br /> Through unprecedented access to the players involved, <i>Too Big to Fail</i> re-creates all the drama and turmoil, revealing neverdisclosed details and elucidating how decisions made on Wall Street over the past decade sowed the seeds of the debacle. This true story is not just a look at banks that were “too big to fail,” it is a real-life thriller with a cast of bold-faced names who themselves thought they were too big to fail.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Unknown to most modern-day investors and traders who cherish Reminiscences of a Stock Operator as one of the most important investment books ever written, the material first appeared in the 1920s as a series of articles and illustrations in the Saturday Evening Post. Now, for the first time ever, this beloved classic is being made available in its original, illustrated format. You'll track the exploits of Jesse Livermore as he won and lost tens of millions of dollars playing the stock and commodities markets during the early 1900s. At one point, he made the then astronomical sum of 10 million dollars in just one month of trading! Originally published as a fictionalized account, the Illustrated Edition combines the Saturday Evening Post's memorable illustrations with Edwin LeFevre's timeless investment advice, recreating the look, feel, and message that was first published more than 80 years ago. Among the most compelling and enduring pieces ever written on trading, the new Illustrated Edition brings this story to life like never before. Order your copy today.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[The definitive work concerning Warren Buffett and intelligent investment philosophy, this is a collection of Buffett's letters to the shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway written over the past few decades that together furnish an enormously valuable informal education. The letters distill in plain words all the basic principles of sound business practices. They are arranged and introduced by a leading apostle of the "value" school and noted author, Lawrence Cunningham. Here in one place are the priceless pearls of business and investment wisdom, woven into a delightful narrative on the major topics concerning both managers and investors. These timeless lessons are ever-more important in the current environment.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA["Simply the most important new stock book of the 1990s, to date. Buy it and read it." -Kenneth L. Fisher Forbes<br /><br />The runaway bestseller-updated with new material included for the first time!<br /><br />"The Warren Buffett Way outlines his career and presents examples of how his investment techniques and methods evolved and the important individuals in that process. It also details the key investment decisions that produced his unmatched record of performance." -from the Foreword by Peter S. Lynch Bestselling author, One Up on Wall Street and Beating the Street<br /><br />". . . an extraordinarily useful account of the methods of an investor held by many to be the world's greatest." -The Wall Street Journal<br /><br />"Robert Hagstrom presents an in-depth examination of Warren Buffett's strategies, and the 'how and why' behind his selection of each of the major securities that have contributed to his remarkable record of success. His 'homespun' wisdom and philosophy are also part of this comprehensive, interesting, and readable book." -John C. Bogle Chairman, The Vanguard Group<br /><br />"It's first rate. Buffett gets a lot of attention for what he preaches, but nobody has described what he practices better than Hagstrom. Here is the lowdown on every major stock he ever bought and why he bought it. Fascinating. You could even try this at home." -John Rothchild Financial columnist Time magazine]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Legendary money manager Peter Lynch explains his own strategies for investing and offers advice for how to pick stocks and mutual funds to assemble a successful investment portfolio.<br /><br />Develop a Winning Investment Strategy—with Expert Advice from “The Nation’s #1 Money Manager.” Peter Lynch’s “invest in what you know” strategy has made him a household name with investors both big and small.<br /><br />An important key to investing, Lynch says, is to remember that stocks are not lottery tickets. There’s a company behind every stock and a reason companies—and their stocks—perform the way they do. In this book, Peter Lynch shows you how you can become an expert in a company and how you can build a profitable investment portfolio, based on your own experience and insights and on straightforward do-it-yourself research.<br /><br />In Beating the Street, Lynch for the first time explains how to devise a mutual fund strategy, shows his step-by-step strategies for picking stock, and describes how the individual investor can improve his or her investment performance to rival that of the experts.<br /><br />There’s no reason the individual investor can’t match wits with the experts, and this book will show you how.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[This gimmick-free, irreverent, and vastly informative guide―with over half a million copies sold―shows how to navigate the turbulence on Wall Street and beat the pros at their own game. Skilled at puncturing financial bubbles and other delusions of the Wall Street crowd, Burton Malkiel shows why a broad portfolio of stocks selected at random will match the performance of one carefully chosen by experts. Taking a shrewd look at the high-tech boom and its aftermath, Malkiel shows how to maximize gains and minimize losses in this era of electronic brokers, virtual gurus, and flashy investment vehicles. Learn how to analyze the potential returns, not only for stocks and bonds, but for the full range of investment opportunities, from money market accounts and real estate investment trusts to insurance, home owning, and tangible assets like gold and collectibles. Decode the rating game for mutual funds and discover the unique advantages of index mutual funds over the wide range of riskier alternatives. Year in and year out the best investing guide money can buy, this enhanced edition includes an update of Malkiel's famous "Life-Cycle Guide to Investing," showing how to match an investment strategy to your stage in life.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[During his fourteen years as Yale's chief investment officer, David F. Swensen has transformed the management of the university's portfolio. Largely by focusing on nonconventional strategies, including a heavy allocation to private equity, Swensen has achieved an annualized return of 16.2 percent, which has propelled Yale's endowment into the top tier of institutional funds. Now, this acknowledged leader of fund managers draws on his experience and deep knowledge of the financial markets to provide a compendium of powerful investment strategies. Swensen presents an overview of the investment world populated by institutional fund managers, pension fund fiduciaries, investment managers, and trustees of universities, museums, hospitals, and foundations. He offers penetrating insights from his experience managing Yale's endowment, ranging from broad issues of goals and investment philosophy to the strategic and tactical aspects of portfolio management. Swensen's exceptionally readable book addresses critical concepts such as handling risk, selecting investment advisers, and negotiating the opportunities and pitfalls in individual asset classes. Fundamental investment ideas are illustrated by real-world concrete examples, and each chapter contains strategies that any manager can put into action. At a time when it is becoming increasingly difficult to cope with the relentless challenges provided by today's financial markets, Swensen's book is an indispensable roadmap for creating a successful investment program for every institutional fund manager. Any student of markets will benefit from Pioneering Portfolio Management.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Robert Kiyosaki nos motiva a dejar de pensar que estamos destinados a tener problemas financieros el resto de nuestras vidas y, en cambio, nos invita a asumirnos capaces de crear la vida que deseamos.<br /><br />Este libro nos revela el poder de la educación financiera y las cinco ventajas que ella ofrece:<br /><br />• La ventaja del conocimiento<br />• La ventaja de los impuestos<br />• La ventaja de la deuda<br />• La ventaja del riesgo financiero<br />• La ventaja de la remuneración<br /><br />Al más puro estilo de Padre Rico, Padre Pobre , La ventaja del ganador nos ayudará a comprobar cómo el poder de la educación financiera será nuestra gran ventaja ganadora.<br /><br />ENGLISH DESCRIPTION<br /><br />On the heels of his 2010 New York Times bestseller Conspiracy of the Rich , Robert Kiyosaki takes a new and hard-hitting look at the factors that impact people from all walks of life as they struggle to cope with change and challenges that impact their financial world.<br /><br />In  An Unfair Advantage: The Power of Financial Education Robert underscores his messages and challenges readers to change their context and act in a new way. Readers are advised to stop blindly accepting that they are ‘disadvantaged’ people with limited options. They are encouraged to act beyond their concept of limited options and challenge the preconception that they will struggle financially all of their lives.<br /><br />Robert’s fresh approach to his time-tested messages includes clear, actionable steps that any individual or family can take, starting with education. Education becomes applied knowledge, a powerful tactic with measurable results.<br /><br />In true Rich Dad style, readers will be challenged to understand two points of view, and experience how financial knowledge is their unfair advantage.<br /><br />Why do the rich get richer even in a financial crisis? In his new book, Unfair Advantage , Robert confirms his message and challenges readers to change their context and act in a new way. Readers are advised to stop blindly accepting that they are ‘disadvantaged’ people with limited options and challenge the notion that they will struggle, financially, all their lives.<br /><br />What does school teach you about money? In most cases, the answer is “Not much.” If there is any financial education, the courses are taught by financial planners and bankers… the agents of Wall Street and the big banks, the very people that caused and profited from the financial crisis.<br /><br />This book is about real financial education. This book is about how debt and taxes make the rich richer hellip and why debt and taxes makes the poor and middle class struggle.<br /><br />This book explains why the rich get richer, paying less in taxes, while the middle class shrinks with many losing jobs, homes, and retirement and paying more in taxes. This book is about the five unfair advantages a real financial education offers.<br /><br />The Unfair Advantage of Knowledge<br />The Unfair Advantage of Taxes<br />The Unfair Advantage of Debt<br />The Unfair Advantage of Risk<br />The Unfair Advantage of Compensation<br /><br />These five unfair advantages are the outcomes of real financial education.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<b>Will there ever be another investing book like this? It's unlikely.</b><br /><br />University of Berkshire Hathaway is a remarkable retelling of the lessons, wisdom, and investment strategies handed down personally from Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger to shareholders during 30 years of their closed-door annual meetings. <br /><br />From this front row seat, you'll see one of the greatest wealth-building records in history unfold, year by year.<br /><br />If you're looking for dusty old investment theory, there are hundreds of other books waiting to cure you of insomnia. However, if you're looking for an investing book that's as personal as it is revelatory, look no further.<br /><br />Packed with Buffett and Munger's timeless, generous, and often hilarious wisdom, University of Berkshire Hathaway will keep serious investors turning pages late into the night:<br /><br />• Get unique insight into the thinking, strategies, and decisions--both good and bad--that made Buffett and Munger two of the world's greatest investors. <br /><br />• Understand the critical reasoning that leads Buffett and Munger to purchase a particular company, including their methods for assigning value.<br /><br />• Learn the central tenets of Buffett's value-investing philosophy "straight from the horse's mouth."<br /><br />• Enjoy Munger's biting wit as he goes after any topic that offends him.<br /><br />• Discover Buffett's distaste for "commonly accepted strategies" like modern portfolio theory.<br /><br />• See why these annual meetings are often called "an MBA in a weekend."]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[A menudo, parece como si los traders con experiencia se deslizaran airosamente sobre los mercados, entrando y saliendo de las posiciones. Su trading parecefácil, como la práctica del esquí cuesta abajo que vemos en la televisión. Pero la ilusión se desvanece cuando uno se calza un par de esquís y descubre los bultos a lo largo de la pendiente. Si quiere usted elevarse al nivel de un auténtico trader tiene que trabajar, estudiar y hacer los deberes. Escribí esta Guía de ejercicios para ayudarle a desarrollarse y tener éxito como trader. Está basada en mis años de experiencia como trader y como profesor de traders. Cuanto más estudie usted los mercados y sus propias reacciones a los mismos, más probabilidades de éxito tendrá. Cada pregunta de este libro se refiere a una sección específica de mi libro Vivir del Trading, publicado en esta misma editorial. Puede usted beneficiarse de esta guía tanto si leyó el libro como si no lo hizo; pero si se implica profundamente en estas preguntas, querrá leer los capítulos relevantes en Vivir del Trading. El trading es en parte ciencia y en parte arte -es parcialmente objetivo y parcialmente subjetivo. Esta guía plantea cuestiones sobre el trading y proporciona las respuestas, pero personas razonables pueden discrepar de algunas de las mismas. Espero que esta guía le suponga un reto para pensar sobre los mercados. Todas las preguntas de esta guía están agrupadas por temas: psicología, gestión del dinero, indicadores técnicos, y así sucesivamente. Escriba sus preguntas y busque pautas generales en sus puntos fuertes y en sus flaquezas. Es necesario que aprenda más acerca de usted mismo y sobre los mercados -los buenos traders siempre aprenden.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[While many books explain the how of bitcoin, The Internet of Money delves into the why of bitcoin. Acclaimed information-security expert and author of Mastering Bitcoin, Andreas M. Antonopoulos examines and contextualizes the significance of bitcoin through a series of essays spanning the exhilarating maturation of this technology. Bitcoin, a technological breakthrough quietly introduced to the world in 2008, is transforming much more than finance. Bitcoin is disrupting antiquated industries to bring financial independence to billions worldwide. In this book, Andreas explains why bitcoin is a financial and technological evolution with potential far exceeding the label “digital currency.” Andreas goes beyond exploring the technical functioning of the bitcoin network by illuminating bitcoin’s philosophical, social, and historical implications. As the internet has essentially transformed how people around the world interact and has permanently impacted our lives in ways we never could have imagined, bitcoin -- the internet of money -- is fundamentally changing our approach to solving social, political, and economic problems through decentralized technology.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[This text delves into HTML and CSS organically. Each chapter focuses on a variety of HTML and CSS elements, together, in a context of practical and functional examples. Instead of dissecting each feature myopically, this book jumps into the "thick of it" and considers each HTML and CSS element in combination with other elements that are needed to make a given case work. For example, in chapter 2, explanations on how to build tooltips are provided, and topics, such as CSS selectors, absolute and relative positioning, text effects, CSS functions, and transformations, are covered. The key philosophical principle guiding this series is that software systems are synergistic combinations of diverse technologies; and, successful learning of these technologies is best facilitated via detailed and, importantly, immersive examples. Building functional mini-applications requires the fluent use of a broad range of HTML and CSS vocabularies. The cases presented in this series fully capture the richness of HTML and CSS languages.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Used in millions of web pages, JavaScript is an excellent teaching language and ideal for students delving into computer science for the first time. Designed specifically for the CS1 introductory programming course, Programming with JavaScript: Algorithms and Applications for Desktop and Mobile Browsers introduces students to computer science and programming using a modern approach. The text correlates to the ACM/IEEE CS1 course requirements and provides real-world case studies and numerous exercises throughout. The case studies show readers actual examples and their development from inception to final product. The authors cover unique topics not typically found in an introductory-level text, such as 2D and 3D graphics in web pages, multitouch and gesture interfaces, distributed computing, software engineering fundamentals, and coverage of powerful tools such as jQuery and regular expressions. To stress the importance of hands-on application in learning a programming language, the authors also provide numerous examples of working code, as well as exercises involving modification of that code. Key Features: -Addresses the knowledge units from the ACM/IEEE Computer Science Computing Curricula for introductory programming courses, and covers security and net-centric computing topics as recommended in the ACM revised report CC2008. -Provides a step-by-step introduction to programming in JavaScript. -Focuses on the basics and functionality of JavaScript and software engineering principles. -Provides a solid foundation in programming by stressing fundamentals early. This text takes full advantage of the expressive power of JavaScript's object literals and functions-as-values features to give students an early appreciation of the importance of data structures. -Includes self-contained, functionally complete case studies that illustrate and integrate key concepts while also providing concrete examples of the best practices described in the text. -Contains numerous exercises throughout for students to immediately test and apply their understanding of the material. The exercises are chosen to represent recognizable applications and use cases from real-world web applications, while also exposing students to additional material that goes beyond what is provided in the chapter.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[The book is for anyone who wants to learn how to modify Minecraft--no previous programming experience required! The book uses JavaScript, a popular programming language for creating websites and scripting. <br />Aimed at kids who already play Minecraft, this guide will teach coding through a series of "Recipes" (the term used in-game when crafting new objects). For example, in the game, one of the first things any player must do is create a Workbench, or Crafting Table, which will in turn enable the player to create sophisticated tools. Recipe 1 in the book (the term Recipe and Chapter is interchangeable) is 'A modding Workbench' and its ingredients are the tools the reader will need to begin modding. <br />The goal of each Recipe/chapter is to introduce a new JavaScript concept or expand upon a previously introduced concept. The author will present each recipe as a useful addition to the game while gently introducing programming concepts in an approachable style. This unique approach gets over the problem of introducing JavaScript in an interesting way and avoids spending 3 or 4 chapters explaining JavaScript core concepts in a vacuum. Several Recipes will be covered, including Rolling Dice, Snowball Fight, Piggie Pandemonium, Advanced Modding, and more. <br />"]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Key FeaturesLearn JavaScript from scratch by building clones of popular web applicationsUnderstand the core concepts and techniques surrounding JavaScript with this power-packed hands-on guideExplore modern JavaScript frameworks and libraries such as Node, React and Webpack Book DescriptionJavaScript is the programming language that all web developers need to learn. The first item on our JavaScript to-do list is building g a To-do list app, which you'll have done by the end of the first chapter. You'll explore DOM manipulation with JavaScript and work with event listeners. You'll work with images and text to build a Meme creator. You will also learn about ES (ECMAScript) classes, and will be introduced to layouts using the CSS3 Flexbox.<br /><br />You'll also develop a responsive Event Registration form that allows users to register for your upcoming event and use charts and graphics to display registration data. You will then build a weather application, which will show you different ways perform AJAX requests and work with dynamic, external data. WebRTC enables real-time communication in a web browser; you'll learn how to use it when you build a real-time video-call and chat application later in the book.<br /><br />Towards the end of the book, you will meet React, Facebook's JavaScript library for building user interfaces. You'll throw together a blog with React, and get a feel for why this kind of JavaScript framework is used to build large-scale applications. To make your blog more maintainable and scalable, you'll use Redux to manage data across React components.<br /><br />What you will learnA strong understanding of web application development with JavaScript and ES6.A firm foundation on which to master other JavaScript frameworks and libraries.Write maintainable and scalable code by organizing functions into modules.Importance of tools such as Node, NPM, Babel, and Webpack in Front-end development.Work with real-time data such as incoming video streams, texts, and so onIntegrate React with JavaScript to build large-scale applications.Utilize Redux to manage data across React components and greatly speed up the development processAbout the Author<b>Dani Akash S</b> is a passionate, self-taught application developer who loves working on the JavaScript stack.

    <book_description><![CDATA[Strengthen your applications by adopting Test-Driven Development (TDD), the OpenAPI Specification, Continuous Integration (CI), and container orchestration. With the over-abundance of tools in the JavaScript ecosystem, it's easy to feel lost. Build tools, package managers, loaders, bundlers, linters, compilers, transpilers, typecheckers - how do you make sense of it all? In this book, we will build a simple API and React application from scratch. We begin by setting up our development environment using Git, yarn, Babel, and ESLint. Then, we will use Express, Elasticsearch and JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) to build a stateless API service. For the front-end, we will use React, Redux, and Webpack. A central theme in the book is maintaining code quality. As such, we will enforce a Test-Driven Development (TDD) process using Selenium, Cucumber, Mocha, Sinon, and Istanbul. As we progress through the book, the focus will shift towards automation and infrastructure. You will learn to work with Continuous Integration (CI) servers like Jenkins, deploying services inside Docker containers, and run them on Kubernetes. By following this book, you would gain the skills needed to build robust, production-ready applications. If you're a JavaScript developer looking to expand your skillset and become a senior JavaScript developer by building production-ready web applications, then this book is for you.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[This book, as its name implies, is about playing with fractals, strange attractors and chaos theory. By "playing" is meant writing computer programs that will generate fractals and other related forms. By learning the principles behind the shapes and the code that creates these images, you will gain a far greater understanding of and appreciation for the subject. You will also be able to experiment with these concepts on a level that you could probably never achieve if you were just randomly tweaking some sliders in someone else's application.JavaScript was chosen for the programming language in this book for multiple reasons.First, JavaScript is free, open, cross-platform, doesn't require any special programming environment, and (with HTML5 running in modern browsers) is powerful enough to do most of the computation and rendering that will be needed. Chances are that the computer you are currently using has everything you need to create and run almost all of the examples in this book. All that is required is a text editor and a modern browser -- any of the latest versions of Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Opera.Second, notwithstanding a few oddities, JavaScript is a relatively easy language to pick up and become productive in very quickly. While I am assuming you have some basic programming experience, you won't need to have an extensive background in JavaScript itself to get the examples up and running. Chances are, no matter what programming language you might be familiar with, you will be able to get up to speed with the code in this book rather quickly, even if you've never touched JavaScript before.Finally, the intent of this book is not to supply you with a bunch of programs that you blindly copy and run. The idea is that you will understand what is happening in the code and why, and use the example programs as a starting point for your own explorations. As such, this can also include converting the code to the language and platform of your choice. JavaScript's syntax is simple enough that the examples should be readily translatable into most other currently popular languages.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[This book will help you create practical / usable / wickedly-cool animations in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each chapter is filled with cleanly explained concepts, beautifully illustrated diagrams, colorific code snippets, and cringeworthy one-liners guaranteed to make your friend who laughs at everything groan.<br /><br />You will start by learning how to create animations and transitions in CSS. Towards the end, you will learn how to create animations in JavaScript by manipulating DOM elements as well as pushing pixels on the canvas. Along the way, you will see numerous small and large examples explaining how what you are learning applies to what is done in the real world.<br /><br />If you ever get stuck or need a group of friendly people to help you out with your animation-related issues, get free online support, demos, video tutorials, and other good stuff ]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[The best modern JavaScript is simple, readable, and predictable. Learn to write modern JavaScript not by memorizing a list of new syntax, but with practical examples of how syntax changes can make code more expressive. Starting from variable declarations that communicate intention clearly, see how modern principles can improve all parts of code. Incorporate ideas with curried functions, array methods, classes, and more to create code that does more with less while yielding fewer bugs.<br /><br />It's time to write JavaScript code that's clean and exprssive. Modern JavaScript is simpler and more predictable and readable than ever. Discover how to write better code with clear examples using principles that show how updated syntax can make code better with fewer bugs.<br /><br />Starting from the ground up, learn new syntax (or how to reuse older syntax) to transform code from clunky bug-susceptible scripts to clear and elegant programs that are easy to read and easy to extend.<br /><br />Create a foundation for readable code with simple variable declarations that reduce side effects and subtle bugs. Select collections with clear goals instead of defaulting to objects or arrays. See how to simplify iterations from complex loops to single line array methods. Master techniques for writing flexible and solid code ranging from high-order functions, to reusableclasses, to patterns for architecting large applications creating applications that will last while through rounds of refactoring and changing requirements.<br /><br />The best part is there's no need to read this book straight through. Jump around and incorporate new functionality at will. Most importantly, understand not just what the new syntax is, but when and how to use it. Start writing better code from the first page.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<p>There's no doubt that the JavaScript ecosystem changes fast. Not only are new tools and frameworks introduced and developed at a rapid rate, the language itself has undergone big changes with the introduction of ES2015 (aka ES6) and further revisions. Understandably, many articles have been written complaining about how difficult it is to learn modern JavaScript development these days. We're aiming to minimize that confusion with this set of books on modern JavaScript.</p><br /><p>This collection contains:</p><br /> 
   <em>Practical ES6</em> is a collection of articles introducing many of the powerful new JavaScript language features that were introduced in ECMAScript 2015, as well as features introduced in ECMAScript 2016 and 2017. It also takes a look at the features planned for ECMAScript 2018 in this rapidly evolving language. 
   <em>JavaScript: Best Practice</em> presents articles discussing modern JavaScript best practice, enabling you to write more powerful code that is clean, performant, maintainable, and reusable. 
   <em>6 JavaScript Projects</em> presents six complete JavaScript projects; each taking advantage of modern JavaScript and its ecosystem. You'll learn to build several different apps, and along the way you'll pick up a ton of useful advice, tips, and techniques. 
   <em>Modern JavaScript Tools &amp; Skills</em> contains a collection of articles outlining essential tools and skills that every modern JavaScript developer should know. 
 <br /><p>This book is for all front-end developers who wish to improve their JavaScript skills. You'll need to be familiar with HTML and CSS and have a reasonable level of understanding of JavaScript in order to follow the discussion. </p>]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Un modo nuovo e più bello per imparare JavaScript e jQuery. Questo libro è dedicato il chi non conosce JavaScript, a chi non ha esperienze di programmazione e a chi si è limitato copiare e incollare degli script senza avere idea di come realmente funzionino. L'obiettivo è imparare a leggere e scrivere codice JavaScript ma anche comprendere le basi teoriche della programmazione. Tutto questo attraverso un approccio visuale che aiuta a semplificare anche i concetti più complicati. Unico requisito necessario è la conoscenza di HTML e CSS. Pagina dopo pagina il lettore scopre come funziona JavaScript, come personalizzare script e come crearne da zero, ma impara anche a sfruttare le potenzialità di jQuery e le più popolari tecniche di sviluppo per migliorare I'interattività e I'usabilità dei siti web. II testo è ricco di esempi che mostrano l'uso di semplici funzionalità JavaScript fino alle possibilità più evolute per controllare qualsiasi elemento di una pagina web con jQuery, le API e Ajax. In breve il lettore inizia a pensare come un programmatore.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[The 2015 specification for the JavaScript language introduces classes, modules, arrow functions, and more. I sat down and wrote the book I would like to read about these new features. This book is not an exhaustive list of everything new in the ECMAScript 2015 specification that governs the JavaScript language. Instead, I purposefully selected what I think are the important features we will use in everyday programming. I expect the reader will already have a good understanding of the JavaScript language as the language existed before 2015.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<b>Master functional programming techniques with this comprehensive guide for writing cleaner, safer, and performant JavaScript code</b><br /><br />Key FeaturesMaster functional programming in JavaScript to solve real-world development problemsApply functional programming concepts and techniques to everyday JavaScript programmingBring modularity, reusability, and testability to your web appsBook DescriptionFunctional programming is a programming paradigm for developing software using functions. With functional programming, you can write more concise code, with increased concurrency and performance. Moreover, the JavaScript language is particularly compatible with functional programming.<br /><br />In this book, you'll explore major topics in functional programming with JavaScript to effectively produce shorter, cleaner, and testable programs. You'll delve into functional programming, and get up to speed with writing and testing pure functions, and even reducing side-effects, along with discovering other features to make your applications functional in nature. As you advance, you'll cover techniques to simplify coding, apply recursion for loopless coding, achieve immutability, implement design patterns, and also work with data types.<br /><br />By the end of this book, you'll have mastered the JavaScript skills you need to confidently program functional applications.<br /><br />What you will learnCreate reliable code with closures and immutable dataConvert existing methods into pure functions, and loops into recursive methodsDevelop powerful applications with currying and function compositionSeparate the logic of your system from implementation detailsImplement composition and chaining techniques to simplify codingUnderstand how to implement object-oriented programming design patterns in functional programmingWho this book is forIf you are a JavaScript developer who wants to apply functional programming techniques, then this book is for you. Basic knowledge of functional programming concepts is required.<br /><br />Table of ContentsBecoming Functional - Several QuestionsThinking Functionally - A First ExampleStarting Out with Functions - A Core ConceptBehaving Properly - Pure FunctionsProgramming Declaratively - A Better StyleProducing Functions - Higher-Order FunctionsTransforming Functions - Currying and Partial ApplicationConnecting Functions - Pipelining and CompositionDesigning Functions - RecursionEnsuring Purity - ImmutabilityImplementing Design Patterns - The Functional WayBuilding Better Containers - Functional Data Types]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Generative design, once known only to insiders as a revolutionary method of creating artwork, models, and animations with programmed algorithms, has in recent years become a popular tool for designers. By using simple languages such as JavaScript in p5.js, artists and makers can create everything from interactive typography and textiles to 3D-printed furniture to complex and elegant infographics. This updated volume gives a jump-start on coding strategies, with step-by- step tutorials for creating visual experiments that explore the possibilities of color, form, typography, and images. Generative Design includes a gallery of all- new artwork from a range of international designers—fine art projects as well as commercial ones for Nike, Monotype, Dolby Laboratories, the musician Bjork, and others.]]></book_description>
