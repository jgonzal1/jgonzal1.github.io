    <book_description><![CDATA[JavaScript Allongé is a book about programming with functions that uses the JavaScript programming language for the examples and exercises. JavaScript Allongé is for:<br /><br />-- Programmers learning JavaScript who want a thorough grounding in its fundamentals rather than a cursory treatment of its syntax.<br /><br />-- Programmers already using JavaScript who want to go back and take a deep dive into programming with functions and combinators.<br /><br />-- Any programmer curious about programming with functions.<br /><br />JavaScript Allongé's primary focus is functions as first-class values and topics built on those fundamentals such as objects, prototypes, "classes," combinators, method decorators, and fluent APIs.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Like it or not, JavaScript is everywhere these days―from browser to server to mobile―and now you, too, need to learn the language or dive deeper than you have. This concise book guides you into and through JavaScript, written by a veteran programmer who once found himself in the same position. Speaking JavaScript helps you approach the language with four standalone sections. First, a quick-start guide teaches you just enough of the language to help you be productive right away. More experienced JavaScript programmers will find a complete and easy-to-read reference that covers each language feature in depth. Complete contents ]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[If you've used a more traditional object-oriented language, such as C++ or Java, JavaScript probably doesn't seem object-oriented at all. It has no concept of classes, and you don't even need to define any objects in order to write code. But don't be fooled—JavaScript is an incredibly powerful and expressive object-oriented language that puts many design decisions right into your hands.In The Principles of Object-Oriented JavaScript, Nicholas C. Zakas thoroughly explores JavaScript's object-oriented nature, revealing the language's unique implementation of inheritance and other key characteristics. You'll –The difference between primitive and reference values–What makes JavaScript functions so unique–The various ways to create objects–How to define your own constructors–How to work with and understand prototypes–Inheritance patterns for types and objectsThe Principles of Object-Oriented JavaScript will leave even experienced developers with a deeper understanding of JavaScript. Unlock the secrets behind how objects work in JavaScript so you can write clearer, more flexible, and more efficient code.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA["A concise and balanced mix of principles and pragmatics. I loved the tutorial-style game-like program development. This book rekindled my earliest joys of programming. Plus, JavaScript!" —Brendan Eich, creator of JavaScript<br /><br />JavaScript is the language of the Web, and it's at the heart of every modern website from the lowliest personal blog to the mighty Google Apps. Though it's simple for beginners to pick up and play with, JavaScript is not a toy—it's a flexible and complex language, capable of much more than the showy tricks most programmers use it for.<br /><br /><i>Eloquent JavaScript</i> goes beyond the cut-and-paste scripts of the recipe books and teaches you to write code that's elegant and effective. You'll start with the basics of programming, and learn to use variables, control structures, functions, and data structures. Then you'll dive into the real JavaScript artistry: higher-order functions, closures, and object-oriented programming.<br /><br />Along the way you'll learn to:<br /><br /><br />Master basic programming techniques and best practices Harness the power of functional and object-oriented programming Use regular expressions to quickly parse and manipulate strings Gracefully deal with errors and browser incompatibilities Handle browser events and alter the DOM structure Most importantly, <i>Eloquent JavaScript</i> will teach you to express yourself in code with precision and beauty. After all, great programming is an art, not a science—so why settle for a killer app when you can create a masterpiece?]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[No matter how much experience you have with JavaScript, odds are you don't fully understand the language. This concise, in-depth guide takes you inside JavaScript's this structure and object prototypes. You'll learn how they work and why they're integral to behavior delegation-a design pattern in which objects are linked, rather than cloned. Like other books in the "You Don't Know JS" series, this and Object Prototypes dives into trickier parts of the language that many JavaScript programmers simply avoid. Armed with this knowledge, you can become a true JavaScript master.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[“It’s uncommon to have a programming language wonk who can speak in such comfortable and friendly language as David does. His walk through the syntax and semantics of JavaScript is both charming and hugely insightful; reminders of gotchas complement realistic use cases, paced at a comfortable curve. You’ll find when you finish the book that you’ve gained a strong and comprehensive sense of mastery.” ―Paul Irish, developer advocate, Google Chrome “This is not a book for those looking for shortcuts; rather it is hard-won experience distilled into a guided tour. It’s one of the few books on JS that I’ll recommend without hesitation.” ―Alex Russell, TC39 member, software engineer, Google In order to truly master JavaScript, you need to learn how to work effectively with the language’s flexible, expressive features and how to avoid its pitfalls. No matter how long you’ve been writing JavaScript code, Effective JavaScript will help deepen your understanding of this powerful language, so you can build more predictable, reliable, and maintainable programs. Author David Herman, with his years of experience on Ecma’s JavaScript standardization committee, illuminates the language’s inner workings as never before―helping you take full advantage of JavaScript’s expressiveness. Reflecting the latest versions of the JavaScript standard, the book offers well-proven techniques and best practices you’ll rely on for years to come. Effective JavaScript is organized around 68 proven approaches for writing better JavaScript, backed by concrete examples. You’ll learn how to choose the right programming style for each project, manage unanticipated problems, and work more successfully with every facet of JavaScript programming from data structures to concurrency. Key features include]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[If you know HTML &amp; CSS then you know all about web page style and structure; now it's time to give those pages some behavior, some interactivity. Want to understand that code you've been copying and pasting into your web pages? And do it in a way that won't put you to sleep? Then <i>Head First JavaScript Programming</i> is for you.<br /><br /> Learning a programming language is no easy task, but <i>Head First JavaScript Programming</i> uses puzzles, visuals, mysteries, interviews, and fun examples to make learning JavaScript fast, fun, and effective. But don't be fooled; you might be having a good time while you're learning JavaScript, but you're still learning all the serious stuff. Like how functions and objects work, what a callback is, how to interact with the web page using the Document Object Model, how to use arrays, and even what a closure is. JavaScript is one of the most popular languages in the world, and it's only getting more popular as the Web continues to grow. Learn JavaScript the Head First way, and get in on all the action.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<b>About This Book</b><br />Learn how to use the most used data structures such as array, stack, list, tree, and graphs with real-world examples<br />Get a grasp on which one is best between searching and sorting algorithms and learn how to implement them<br />Follow through solutions for notable programming problems with step-by-step explanations<br /><br /><b>Who This Book Is For</b><br />If you are a JavaScript developer or someone who has basic knowledge of JavaScript, and want to explore its optimum ability, this fast-paced book is definitely for you. Programming logic is the only thing you need to know to start having fun with algorithms.<br /><br /><b>In Detail</b><br />A data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer to utilize resources efficiently. Data structures and algorithms are the base of every solution to any programming problem.<br /><br />This book begins by covering the basics of the JavaScript language and then moves on to discuss the most important data structures such as array, queue, stack, and linked list. You will also gain an in-depth knowledge of how hash tables and set data structure function. After this, you will be taught what trees are, and how to use the binary tree and the binary search tree.<br /><br />In subsequent chapters, you will learn about graphs, DFS, and BFS. Finally, we will round off by learning how to differentiate between various searching and sorting algorithms such as sequential search, binary search, quick sort, bubble sort, and so on, and how to implement them. Towards the end of the book, you will also be introduced to dynamic programming.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[This step-by-step guide represents over 3.5 years of Massive Multi-Player Games (MMoG) research using WebSockets, Block-chain, and WebRTC. It goes beyond the typical fast-food junk deployments found in all other MMoG tutorials &amp; books. This book includes both Phaser v2.x.x &amp; v3.16+ Gaming Frameworks and licenses valued at $192.00. This book includes game design and implementation chapters using either Phaser JavaScript Gaming Frameworks v2.6.2, CE, v3.16+, AND other Gaming Frameworks for front- and back-end development. It is the Book of 5 Rings - "HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and SQL". It further analyzes several freely available back-end servers and supporting middleware (such as PHP, Python, and several CMS). This game design workbook takes you step-by-step into massively multiplayer online game creation as a profitable business adventure - none of this theoretical local workstation proof of concept! It uses any popular gaming framework -- not limited to Phaser.JS!! -- on the client-side browser interfacing into a unique, server-side, application using WebSockets. It is the only book of its kind since January 2017!Part I leads you through the world of networks, business considerations, MMoG analysis, and setting up a studio workshop. I have 37 years of networking career experience in highly sensitive (i.e., Government Embassies) data communications. I am a certified Cisco Academy Instructor and have taught networking, networking security, game design/development, and software engineering for the past 14 years at the undergraduate level. Part II Guides you into Multi-player Online Game architecture contrasted to normal single-player games. This lays the foundation for Multi-Player Game Prototypes and reviews a missing aspect in current MMoG development not seen in many online tutorials and sample codes. Part III consists of 3 chapters on production and development for the client-side code, server-side code, and MMoG app code. This content is what your Phaser tutorials and Phaser Starter-Kits on the market today overlook and never tell you! Upon completion of Part III, you will have your own bespoke MMoG. Part IV features several Tutorial "Walk-Throughs" - Step-by-Step instructions, Gaming Rules, Logic, and using Game Recipes System™. The Emancipation Wars is a Strategic turn-based, multi-player Fantasy Role-Playing Game of high adventure and legendary deeds.

    <book_description><![CDATA[Darwin's theory of natural selection issued a profound challenge to orthodox thought and belief: no being or species has been specifically created; all are locked into a pitiless struggle for existence, with extinction looming for those not fitted for the task. <br /><br />Yet <i>The Origin of Species</i> (1859) is also a humane and inspirational vision of ecological interrelatedness, revealing the complex mutual interdependencies between animal and plant life, climate and physical environment, and—by implication—within the human world. <br /><br />Written for the general reader, in a style which combines the rigour of science with the subtlety of literature, <i>The Origin of Species</i> remains one of the founding documents of the modern age.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<b>Exploit the Power of Modern JavaScript and Avoid the Pitfalls</b> JavaScript was originally designed for small-scale programming in web browsers, but modern JavaScript is radically different. Nowadays, JavaScript programmers actively embrace functional, object-oriented, and asynchronous programming, while deprecating error-prone concepts from the past. <b>Modern JavaScript for the Impatient</b> is a complete yet concise guide to JavaScript E6 and beyond. Rather than first requiring you to learn and transition from older versions, it helps you quickly get productive with today’s far more powerful versions and rapidly move from languages such as Java, C#, C, or C++. Bestselling programming author Cay S. Horstmann covers all you need to know, provided in small chunks organized for quick access and easy understanding. Horstmann’s practical insights and sample code help you take advantage of all that’s new, avoid common pitfalls and obsolete features, and make the most of modern JavaScript’s robust toolchains and frameworks. Quickly master modern JavaScript’s implementation of fundamental programming constructs Avoid legacy techniques that create unnecessary complexity and risk Make the most of functional, object-oriented, and asynchronous techniques Use modules to efficiently organize and run complex programs Write more powerful, flexible, and concise programs with metaprogramming Extend JavaScript’s power via JavaScript libraries, frameworks, and platforms Whether you’re just getting started with JavaScript or you’re an experienced developer, this guide will help you write tomorrow’s most robust, efficient, and secure JavaScript code. Register your book for convenient access to downloads, updates, and/or corrections as they become available. See inside book for details.  ]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Andrew "Ender" Wiggin thinks he is playing computer simulated war games; he is, in fact, engaged in something far more desperate. The result of genetic experimentation, Ender may be the military genius Earth desperately needs in a war against an alien enemy seeking to destroy all human life. The only way to find out is to throw Ender into ever harsher training, to chip away and find the diamond inside, or destroy him utterly. Ender Wiggin is six years old when it begins. He will grow up fast.<br /><br />But Ender is not the only result of the experiment. The war with the Buggers has been raging for a hundred years, and the quest for the perfect general has been underway almost as long. Ender's two older siblings, Peter and Valentine, are every bit as unusual as he is, but in very different ways. While Peter was too uncontrollably violent, Valentine very nearly lacks the capability for violence altogether. Neither was found suitable for the military's purpose. But they are driven by their jealousy of Ender, and by their inbred drive for power. Peter seeks to control the political process, to become a ruler. Valentine's abilities turn more toward the subtle control of the beliefs of commoner and elite alike, through powerfully convincing essays. Hiding their youth and identities behind the anonymity of the computer networks, these two begin working together to shape the destiny of Earth-an Earth that has no future at all if their brother Ender fails.]]></book_description>

Unless...<br /><br />In 2011, Jake Epping, an English teacher from Lisbon Falls, Maine, sets out on an insane — and insanely possible — mission to prevent the Kennedy assassination.<br /><br />Leaving behind a world of computers and mobile phones, he goes back to a time of big American cars and diners, of Lindy Hopping, the sound of Elvis, and the taste of root beer.<br /><br />In this haunting world, Jake falls in love with Sadie, a beautiful high school librarian. And, as the ominous date of 11/22/63 approaches, he encounters a troubled loner named Lee Harvey Oswald...]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<b>Ken Follett is known worldwide as the master of split-second suspense, but his most beloved and bestselling book tells the magnificent tale of a twelfth-century monk driven to do the seemingly impossible: build the greatest Gothic cathedral the world has ever known.</b><br /><br />Everything readers expect from Follett is here: intrigue, fast-paced action, and passionate romance. But what makes <i>The Pillars of the Earth</i> extraordinary is the time the twelfth century; the place feudal England; and the subject the building of a glorious cathedral. Follett has re-created the crude, flamboyant England of the Middle Ages in every detail. The vast forests, the walled towns, the castles, and the monasteries become a familiar landscape. <br /><br />Against this richly imagined and intricately interwoven backdrop, filled with the ravages of war and the rhythms of daily life, the master storyteller draws the reader irresistibly into the intertwined lives of his characters into their dreams, their labors, and their loves: Tom, the master builder; Aliena, the ravishingly beautiful noblewoman; Philip, the prior of Kingsbridge; Jack, the artist in stone; and Ellen, the woman of the forest who casts a terrifying curse. From humble stonemason to imperious monarch, each character is brought vividly to life.<br /><br />The building of the cathedral, with the almost eerie artistry of the unschooled stonemasons, is the center of the drama. Around the site of the construction, Follett weaves a story of betrayal, revenge, and love, which begins with the public hanging of an innocent man and ends with the humiliation of a king.<br /><br /><i>For the TV tie-in edition with the same ISBN go to this <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17229203-the-pillars-of-the-earth" rel="nofollow noopener">Alternate Cover Edition</a></i><br />]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<b><i>“The Trunchbull”</i> is no match for Matilda!</b><br /><br />Matilda is a little girl who is far too good to be true. At age five-and-a-half she's knocking off double-digit multiplication problems and blitz-reading Dickens. Even more remarkably, her classmates love her even though she's a super-nerd and the teacher's pet. But everything is not perfect in Matilda's world...<br /><br />For starters she has two of the most idiotic, self-centered parents who ever lived. Then there's the large, busty nightmare of a school principal, Miss ("The") Trunchbull, a former hammer-throwing champion who flings children at will, and is approximately as sympathetic as a bulldozer. Fortunately for Matilda, she has the inner resources to deal with such annoyances: astonishing intelligence, saintly patience, and an innate predilection for revenge.<br /><br /><b>

    <book_description><![CDATA["Once there was a tree...and she loved a little boy."<br /><br />So begins a story of unforgettable perception, beautifully written and illustrated by the gifted and versatile Shel Silverstein.<br /><br />Every day the boy would come to the tree to eat her apples, swing from her branches, or slide down her trunk...and the tree was happy. But as the boy grew older he began to want more from the tree, and the tree gave and gave and gave.<br /><br />This is a tender story, touched with sadness, aglow with consolation. Shel Silverstein has created a moving parable for readers of all ages that offers an affecting interpretation of the gift of giving and a serene acceptance of another's capacity to love in return.]]></book_description>

It is The Gravedigger's Handbook, left behind there by accident, and it is her first act of book thievery. So begins a love affair with books and words, as Liesel, with the help of her accordian-playing foster father, learns to read. Soon she is stealing books from Nazi book-burnings, the mayor's wife's library, wherever there are books to be found.<br /><br />But these are dangerous times. When Liesel's foster family hides a Jew in their basement, Liesel's world is both opened up, and closed down.<br /><br />In superbly crafted writing that burns with intensity, award-winning author Markus Zusak has given us one of the most enduring stories of our time.<br /><br />(Note: this title was not published as YA fiction)]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Long ago, in a time forgotten, a preternatural event threw the seasons out of balance. In a land where summers can last decades and winters a lifetime, trouble is brewing. The cold is returning, and in the frozen wastes to the north of Winterfell, sinister forces are massing beyond the kingdom’s protective Wall. To the south, the king’s powers are failing—his most trusted adviser dead under mysterious circumstances and his enemies emerging from the shadows of the throne. At the center of the conflict lie the Starks of Winterfell, a family as harsh and unyielding as the frozen land they were born to. Now Lord Eddard Stark is reluctantly summoned to serve as the king’s new Hand, an appointment that threatens to sunder not only his family but the kingdom itself.<br /><br />Sweeping from a harsh land of cold to a summertime kingdom of epicurean plenty, <i>A Game of Thrones</i> tells a tale of lords and ladies, soldiers and sorcerers, assassins and bastards, who come together in a time of grim omens. Here an enigmatic band of warriors bear swords of no human metal; a tribe of fierce wildlings carry men off into madness; a cruel young dragon prince barters his sister to win back his throne; a child is lost in the twilight between life and death; and a determined woman undertakes a treacherous journey to protect all she holds dear. Amid plots and counter-plots, tragedy and betrayal, victory and terror, allies and enemies, the fate of the Starks hangs perilously in the balance, as each side endeavors to win that deadliest of conflicts: the game of thrones.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Discovered in the attic in which she spent the last years of her life, Anne Frank’s remarkable diary has become a world classic—a powerful reminder of the horrors of war and an eloquent testament to the human spirit. <br /><br />In 1942, with the Nazis occupying Holland, a thirteen-year-old Jewish girl and her family fled their home in Amsterdam and went into hiding. For the next two years, until their whereabouts were betrayed to the Gestapo, the Franks and another family lived cloistered in the “Secret Annexe” of an old office building. Cut off from the outside world, they faced hunger, boredom, the constant cruelties of living in confined quarters, and the ever-present threat of discovery and death. In her diary Anne Frank recorded vivid impressions of her experiences during this period. By turns thoughtful, moving, and surprisingly humorous, her account offers a fascinating commentary on human courage and frailty and a compelling self-portrait of a sensitive and spirited young woman whose promise was tragically cut short.<br />--back cover]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[In Beatrice Prior's dystopian Chicago world, society is divided into five factions, each dedicated to the cultivation of a particular virtue—Candor (the honest), Abnegation (the selfless), Dauntless (the brave), Amity (the peaceful), and Erudite (the intelligent). On an appointed day of every year, all sixteen-year-olds must select the faction to which they will devote the rest of their lives. For Beatrice, the decision is between staying with her family and being who she really is—she can't have both. So she makes a choice that surprises everyone, including herself.<br /><br />During the highly competitive initiation that follows, Beatrice renames herself Tris and struggles alongside her fellow initiates to live out the choice they have made. Together they must undergo extreme physical tests of endurance and intense psychological simulations, some with devastating consequences. As initiation transforms them all, Tris must determine who her friends really are—and where, exactly, a romance with a sometimes fascinating, sometimes exasperating boy fits into the life she's chosen. But Tris also has a secret, one she's kept hidden from everyone because she's been warned it can mean death. And as she discovers unrest and growing conflict that threaten to unravel her seemingly perfect society, she also learns that her secret might help her save those she loves . . . or it might destroy her.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Since its immediate success in 1813, <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> has remained one of the most popular novels in the English language. Jane Austen called this brilliant work "her own darling child" and its vivacious heroine, Elizabeth Bennet, "as delightful a creature as ever appeared in print." The romantic clash between the opinionated Elizabeth and her proud beau, Mr. Darcy, is a splendid performance of civilized sparring. And Jane Austen's radiant wit sparkles as her characters dance a delicate quadrille of flirtation and intrigue, making this book the most superb comedy of manners of Regency England.<br /><br /><i>Alternate cover edition of ISBN 9780679783268</i>]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[The unforgettable novel of a childhood in a sleepy Southern town and the crisis of conscience that rocked it. "To Kill A Mockingbird" became both an instant bestseller and a critical success when it was first published in 1960. It went on to win the Pulitzer Prize in 1961 and was later made into an Academy Award-winning film, also a classic.<br /><br />Compassionate, dramatic, and deeply moving, "To Kill A Mockingbird" takes readers to the roots of human behavior - to innocence and experience, kindness and cruelty, love and hatred, humor and pathos. Now with over 18 million copies in print and translated into forty languages, this regional story by a young Alabama woman claims universal appeal. Harper Lee always considered her book to be a simple love story. Today it is regarded as a masterpiece of American literature.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<b>Could you survive on your own in the wild, with every one out to make sure you don't live to see the morning?</b><br /><br />In the ruins of a place once known as North America lies the nation of Panem, a shining Capitol surrounded by twelve outlying districts. The Capitol is harsh and cruel and keeps the districts in line by forcing them all to send one boy and one girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen to participate in the annual Hunger Games, a fight to the death on live TV.<br /><br />Sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen, who lives alone with her mother and younger sister, regards it as a death sentence when she steps forward to take her sister's place in the Games. But Katniss has been close to dead before—and survival, for her, is second nature. Without really meaning to, she becomes a contender. But if she is to win, she will have to start making choices that weight survival against humanity and life against love.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[This book includes game design and implementation chapters using either Phaser JavaScript Gaming Frameworks v2.6.2, CE, v3.16+, AND any other JS Gaming Frameworks for the front- and back-end development. It is a Book of 5 Rings Game Design - "HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and SQL". It further analyzes several freely available back-end servers and supporting middleware (such as PHP, Python, and several CMS). This game design workbook takes you step-by-step into the creation of Massively Multiplayer Online Game as a profitable business adventure - none of this theoretical, local workstation proof of concept! It uses any popular JavaScript Gaming Framework – not just limited to Phaser.JS!! – on the client-side browser interfacing into a unique, server-side, application using WebSockets. It is the only book of its kind since January 2017 for the Phaser MMO Gaming Framework!<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Part I leads you through the world of networks, business consideration, MMoG analysis and setting up your studio workshop. I have 40 years of networking career experience in highly sensitive (i.e., Government Embassies) data communications. I am a certified Cisco Academy Instructor and have taught networking, networking security, game design/development, and software engineering for the past 14 years at the college level.<br /><br /><br /><br />Part II Guides you into Multi-player Online Game architecture contrasted to normal single-player games. This lays the foundation for Multi-Player Game Prototypes and reviews a missing aspect in current MMoG development not seen in many online tutorials and example code.<br /><br /><br /><br />Part III contains 3 chapters focused on production and development for the client-side code, client-proxy, server-side code, and MMoG app. This content sets the foundation for what many Phaser tutorials and Phaser Starter-Kits on the market today overlook and never tell you! Upon completion of Part III, you will have your bespoke MMoG with integrated micro-service, and if you choose, web workers and block-chain.<br /><br /><br /><br />Part IV (Bonus Content) This section includes proprietary Game Rule Books and EULA source code included as a part of your book purchase. It features four (4) Game Recipes – step-by-step instructions – listed by complexity "1" = easiest (elementary skills) to "4" = most complex (requiring advanced skills across several IT technology disciplines). Each external “Walk-Through Tutorial” guides you in different aspects of MMoG development.<br /><br /><br /><br />How to migrate single-player games into a 2-player online delivery mode (not using "hot-seat")!<br /><br /><br /><br />How to use dynamic client-side proxy servers and migrate this game from its current single-player mode (with AI Bot) into an online 2-player mode (not using "hot-seat")!<br /><br /><br /><br />How to include "Asynchronous Availability" during gameplay and migrate this gameplay mode (with AI Bot) into an online "Asynchronous Availability" 3-player mode using postal mail or email game turns! The FREE game rule book will help "deconstruct" this game mechanics.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[For web developers building rich web and mobile applications, standards-based CSS3 offers powerful advantages over traditional Flash-based approaches - and since Apple's immensely popular iPad and iPhone don't support Flash, moving to CSS3 has become even more urgent. However, most CSS3 guides focus primarily on the basics, frustrating web developers who want to do sophisticated work. Learning CSS3 Animations and Transitions is the first book focused entirely on creating production-quality rich animations and transitions with CSS3. Leading web development trainer Alexis Goldstein covers everything web developers need to know, teaching through solid examples that help web professionals build their skills one step at a time. Readers will learn how * Create 2D transforms that serve as the foundation for CSS3 animations * Use transitions to make changes come alive * Master essential keyframing techniques * Combine transitions, transforms, and parallax scrolling in immersive web experiences * Transform in 3D, and animate 3D transforms * Creating increasingly complex and Flash-style animations * Build powerfully effective interactive infographics with CSS3 and HTML5 * And much more...]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Master React Native with <em>Fullstack React Native</em>The up-to-date, in-depth, complete guide to React Native.<br /><br /><em>Create beautiful mobile apps with JavaScript and React</em><br /><br /><strong>Deliver high quality mobile apps, at light speed.</strong><br /><br />Building the same app in both Swift and Java is time-consuming. With React Native, you can release a native app on both iOS and Android from a single codebase.<br /><br /><strong>Do you or your team already know JavaScript?</strong><br /><br />Leverage your <em>existing knowledge</em> to build world class mobile applications.<br /><br /><strong>The React Native ecosystem is evolving fast. Get started on the right foot.</strong><br /><br />With such an active community and so many updates, it feels impossible to know what's best and what's just noise. We cover the latest React Native version and best practices so you can develop with confidence.<br /><br />What You'll BuildWhen you buy Fullstack React Native, you're not buying just a book, but <strong>dozens</strong> of code examples. Every chapter in the book comes with a complete project that uses the concepts in the chapter and provides support for both iOS (including iPhone X screens) &amp; Android.<br /><br /><br /><br /><strong>A Weather App</strong> - Get your feet wet with React Native by building a weather app allows the user to input their location and grabs weather data from a third party API.<br /><br /><strong>A Time Tracker</strong> - Brush up on your core React knowledge and build a time tracking app.<br /><br /><strong>A Messaging App</strong> - Understand how to use the core React Native APIs like Geolocation, CameraRoll, Keyboard, NetInfo and much more through completing a messaging app<br /><br /><strong>An Instagram Clone</strong> - Learn how to style your app, manage user input, add comments and display photos from Unsplash<br />What You'll BuildWhen you buy Fullstack React Native, you're not buying just a book, but <strong>dozens</strong> of code examples.

We've written the book so that it can be used even if you aren't familiar with React. Although, if you'd like to learn React in depth, checkout our other book Fullstack React<br /><br />Do I have to know JavaScript?Yes, we assume you know the basics of the language. But you don't need to be completely up-to-date: we teach the latest language features in case you're not familiar with them.<br /><br />However, this book teaches React Native from the ground up and you can use it even if you've never written a mobile app before.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[This book presents the most up-to-date coverage of procedural content generation (PCG) for games, specifically the procedural generation of levels, landscapes, items, rules, quests, or other types of content. Each chapter explains an algorithm type or domain, including fractal methods, grammar-based methods, search-based and evolutionary methods, constraint-based methods, and narrative, terrain, and dungeon generation.  The authors are active academic researchers and game developers, and the book is appropriate for undergraduate and graduate students of courses on games and creativity; game developers who want to learn new methods for content generation; and researchers in related areas of artificial intelligence and computational intelligence.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<b>»»» Used copies of this book may be missing critical digital resources. «««</b><br /><br /><b>»»» Updated 2020 edition «««</b><br /><br />The ability to write SQL is one of the most in-demand job skills. Are you prepared?<br /><br />It's easy to find basic SQL syntax information online. What's hard to find is <b>challenging, well-designed, real-world problems</b>—the type of problems that come up when you're dealing with data. Learning how to solve these problems will give you the skill and confidence to step up in your career.<br /><br />With SQL Practice Problems, you can get that level of experience by solving sets of targeted problems. These aren't just problems designed as syntax examples. These are <b>the most common problems you encounter when you deal with data</b>.<br /><br />You will get real world practice, with real world data. I'll teach you <b>how to “think” in SQL</b>, how to analyze data problems, figure out the fundamentals, and work towards a solution that you can be proud of.<br /><br /><b>Can I run SQL Practice Problems on a Mac?</b> No, it requires a computer with Microsoft Windows. I also offer a Professional package at SQLPracticeProblems.com which is suitable for both Windows and Mac.<br /><br /><b>How important is the real-life, hands-on problem solving that you can find in SQL Practice Problems?</b><br /><br />You can watch videos online that will walk you through various aspects of databases, and SQL. And you can read up on SQL syntax and keywords, and review sample code.<br /><br />But...to really absorb and be able to apply your learning, <b>you need to solve real-world problems</b>. Being presented with a SQL problem, and working through that problem (with hints, if necessary) will help you understand and remember like nothing else.<br /><br /><b>What do you get when you buy SQL Practice Problems?</b><br /><br /><br /><br />Setup instructions for Microsoft SQL Server Express Edition and SQL Server Management Studio (Microsoft Windows required). Both are free downloads.A customized practice database, with a video walk-through on setting it up.Practice problems - 57 problems that you work through, step-by-step. There are targeted hints if you need them, which help guide you through the question.Answers and a short, targeted discussion section on each question, with alternative answers and tips on usage and good programming practice.<b>What does SQL Practice Problems not contain?</b><br /><br /><br /><br />Complex descriptions of syntax. There's just what you need, and no more.The differences between every single SQL variant (MS SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, etc). The practice problems are set up with Microsoft SQL Server, and the differences are minor and easy to find online.Details on Insert, Update and Delete statements. The hardest thing to learn in SQL is how to write Select statements that return complex data. Other components of SQL are relatively easy.<b>From customer </b><b>"Probably the most useful technical book I've used!</b> Challenging problems with appropriate hints - use as needed. She should be writing other books."- A. J.<br /><br />"I have numerous books on SQL, and have taken courses from people with lots of experience with data and SQL.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Making a game can be an intensive process, and if not planned accurately can easily run over budget. The use of procedural generation in game design can help with the intricate and multifarious aspects of game development; thus facilitating cost reduction.<b> </b>This form of development enables games to create their play areas, objects and stories based on a set of rules, rather than relying on the developer to handcraft each element individually.<b> </b>Readers will learn to create randomized maps, weave accidental plotlines, and manage complex systems that are prone to unpredictable behavior. Tanya Short’s and Tarn Adams’<b> Procedural Generation in Game Design</b> offers a wide collection of chapters from various experts that cover the implementation and enactment of procedural generation in games. Designers from a variety of studios provide concrete examples from their games to illustrate the many facets of this emerging sub-discipline.<br /><br />Key <br /><br /><br /><br />Introduces the differences between static/traditional game design and procedural game design<br /><br />Demonstrates how to solve or avoid common problems with procedural game design in a variety of concrete ways<br /><br />Includes industry leaders’ experiences and lessons from award-winning games<br /><br />World’s finest guide for how to begin thinking about procedural design]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[SQL Performance Explained helps developers to improve database performance. The focus is on SQL-it covers all major SQL databases without getting lost in the details of any one specific product. Starting with the basics of indexing and the WHERE clause, SQL Performance Explained guides developers through all parts of an SQL statement and explains the pitfalls of object-relational mapping (ORM) tools like Hibernate. Topics covered include: Using multi-column indexes; Correctly applying SQL functions; Efficient use of LIKE queries; Optimizing join operations; Clustering data to improve performance; Pipelined execution of ORDER BY and GROUP BY; Getting the best performance for pagination queries; Understanding the scalability of databases. Its systematic structure makes SQL Performance Explained both a textbook and a reference manual that should be on every developer's bookshelf.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[„Vilniaus džiazas“ – trečiasis Ričardo Gavelio romanas. Vienas pagrindinių jo veikėjų Tomas Kelertas, anot kritikų, – galbūt autobiografiškiausias autoriaus bičiulis. Vilniaus mitologija skleidžiasi džiazo, kurį taip mėgo rašytojas, principu – virtuoziškai vienas iš kito perimdami leitmotyvą, pasakojimai skirtingų veikėjų vidiniu žvilgsniu pinasi į pašėlusią, azartiškais staigiais posūkiais į nepažintas gelmes nešančią partitūrą.<br /><br />„Keistas pamišusio miesto rašytojas. Jis nuolat stebina dorus (pagal požiūrį) miestiečius, tarsi iš šalies stebėdamas susidarančią ir nykstančią tikrovę, eklektiškai aprašydamas liūdną kasdienybės maskaradą: dangų ir pragarą; negerą blogų žmonių aurą; nykius nakties paukščius, šikšnosparnius; Eldorado šalį ir šalį, kurioje pageidautina nešokinėti aukščiau bambos; (...) klusnias meilės verges; klusnias lietuvių rašytojų ataskaitas; lėtą ir apgalvotą rašytojo savižudą; Ėją, kuri praeina pro tave vieną vienintelį kartą.“ (Algimanto Valantiejaus esė ištrauka iš knygos „Bliuzas Ričardui Gaveliui“.)]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<i>The Long Twentieth Century</i> traces the relationship between capital accumulation and state formation over a 700-year period. Arrighi argues that capitalism has unfolded as a succession of “long centuries,” each of which produced a new world power that secured control over an expanding world-economic space. Examining the changing fortunes of Florentine, Venetian, Genoese, Dutch, English and finally American capitalism, Arrighi concludes with an examination of the forces that have shaped and are now poised to undermine America’s world dominance. A masterpiece of historical sociology, <i>The Long Twentieth Century</i> rivals in scope and ambition contemporary classics by Perry Anderson, Charles Tilly and Michael Mann.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[For decades, Dr. Jeffrey Bland has been on the cutting edge of Functional Medicine, which seeks to pinpoint and prevent the cause of illness, rather than treat its symptoms. Managing chronic diseases accounts for three quarters of our total healthcare costs, because we're masking these illnesses with pills and temporary treatments, rather than addressing their underlying causes, he argues. Worse, only treating symptoms leads us down the path of further illness.<br /><br />In The Disease Delusion, Dr. Bland explains what Functional Medicine is and what it can do for you. While advances in modern science have nearly doubled our lifespans in only four generations, our quality of life has not reached its full potential. Outlining the reasons why we suffer chronic diseases from asthma and diabetes to obesity, arthritis and cancer to a host of other ailments, Dr. Bland offers achievable, science-based solutions that can alleviate these common conditions and offers a roadmap for a lifetime of wellness.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[This book is a practical guide to discovering and exploiting security flaws in web applications. The authors explain each category of vulnerability using real-world examples, screen shots and code extracts. The book is extremely practical in focus, and describes in detail the steps involved in detecting and exploiting each kind of security weakness found within a variety of applications such as online banking, e-commerce and other web applications. The topics covered include bypassing login mechanisms, injecting code, exploiting logic flaws and compromising other users. Because every web application is different, attacking them entails bringing to bear various general principles, techniques and experience in an imaginative way. The most successful hackers go beyond this, and find ways to automate their bespoke attacks. This handbook describes a proven methodology that combines the virtues of human intelligence and computerized brute force, often with devastating results. The authors are professional penetration testers who have been involved in web application security for nearly a decade. They have presented training courses at the Black Hat security conferences throughout the world. Under the alias "PortSwigger", Dafydd developed the popular Burp Suite of web application hack tools.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[An assemblage of troubled grotesques struggle to retain identity and humanity in an alternately menacing and mysterious Vilnius, the Lithuanian capital, under Soviet rule in the 1970s and 1980s. The late Gavelis's first translation into English centers on Vytautas Vargalys, a semijustifiably paranoid labor camp survivor who works at a library no one visits while he desperately investigates the Them or They responsible for dehumanizing and killing the humans around him, including his wife, Irena; his genius friend, Gedis; and the young siren, Lolita. Meanwhile, failed intellectual Martynas chronicles Vargalys's struggle and the city's mysterious energy in his mlog, library worker Stefanija Monkeviciute dwells on her wavering faith and personal humiliations, and the city itself speaks in the voice of a dog, claiming that Vilnius can't distinguish dreams from reality. Wrought—and fraught—with symbolism and ennui, the oppressive internal monologues of the characters and the city show the intense importance and equal absurdity of life.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<b>Capitalism is not a natural and inevitable consequence of human nature, nor is it simply an extension of age-old practices of trade and commerce.</b><br /><br />In this original and provocative book Ellen Meiksins Wood reminds us that capitalism is not a natural and inevitable consequence of human nature, nor is it simply an extension of age-old practices of trade and commerce. Rather, it is a late and localized product of very specific historical conditions, which required great transformations in social relations and in the human interaction with nature.<br /><br />This new edition is substantially revised and expanded, with extensive new material on imperialism, anti-Eurocentric history, capitalism and the nation-state, and the differences between capitalism and non-capitalist commerce. The author traces links between the origin of capitalism and contemporary conditions such as globalization, ecological degradation, and the current agricultural crisis.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[In this classic work, distinguished French economic historian, Marc Bloch, discusses the techniques of historical observation, analysis, and criticism, and the reestablishment of historical causation in assessing events. What is the value of history? What is the use of history? How do scholars attempt to unpack it and make connections in a responsible manner? <br /> <br />While the topics of historiography and historical methodology have become increasingly popular, Bloch remains an authority. He argues that history is a whole; no period and no topic can be understood except in relation to other periods and topics. And what is unique about Bloch is that he puts his theories into practice; for example, calling upon both his experience serving in WWI as well as his many years spent in peaceful study and reflection. He also argues that written records are not enough; a historian must draw upon maps, place-names, ancient tools, aerial surveys, folklore, and everything that is available. <br /> <br />This is a work that argues constantly for a wider, more human history. For a history that describes how and why people live and work together. There is a living, breathing connection between the past and the present and it is the historian’s responsibility to do it justice.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[The debut cookbook from Joshua McFadden, a chef with the soul of a farmer and the palate of a visionary<br /><br />Joshua McFadden, chef and owner of renowned trattoria Ava Gene’s in Portland, Oregon, is a vegetable whisperer. After years racking up culinary cred at New York City restaurants like Lupa, Momofuku, and Blue Hill, he managed the trailblazing Four Season Farm in coastal Maine, where he developed an appreciation for every part of the plant and learned to coax the best from vegetables at each stage of their lives.<br /><br />In Six Seasons, McFadden channels both farmer and chef, highlighting the evolving attributes of vegetables throughout their growing seasons—an arc from spring to early summer to midsummer to the bursting harvest of late summer, then ebbing into autumn and, finally, the earthy, mellow sweetness of winter. Each chapter begins with recipes featuring raw vegetables at the start of their season. As weeks progress, McFadden turns up the heat—grilling and steaming, then moving on to sautés, pan roasts, braises, and stews. His ingenuity is on display in 225 revelatory recipes that celebrate flavor at its peak.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Think of developmental psychology, and the name of Jean Piaget immediately springs to mind. His theory of learning lies at the very heart of the modern understanding of the human learning process, and he is celebrated as the founding father of child psychology. A prolific writer, is the author of more than fifty books and several hundred articles. <em>The Psychology of Intelligence</em> is one of his most important works. Containing a complete synthesis of his thoughts on the mechanisms of intellectual development, it is an extraordinary volume by an extraordinary writer. Given his significance, it is hardly surprising that <em>Psychology Today</em> pronounced Piaget the Best Psychologist of the twentieth century.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[An algorithm is nothing more than a step-by-step procedure for solving a problem. The algorithms you'll use most often as a programmer have already been discovered, tested, and proven. If you want to take a hard pass on Knuth's brilliant but impenetrable theories and the dense multi-page proofs you'll find in most textbooks, this is the book for you. This fully-illustrated and engaging guide makes it easy for you to learn how to use algorithms effectively in your own programs.<br /><br />Grokking Algorithms is a disarming take on a core computer science topic. In it, you'll learn how to apply common algorithms to the practical problems you face in day-to-day life as a programmer. You'll start with problems like sorting and searching. As you build up your skills in thinking algorithmically, you'll tackle more complex concerns such as data compression or artificial intelligence. Whether you're writing business software, video games, mobile apps, or system utilities, you'll learn algorithmic techniques for solving problems that you thought were out of your grasp. For example, you'll be able to:<br />Write a spell checker using graph algorithms<br />Understand how data compression works using Huffman coding<br />Identify problems that take too long to solve with naive algorithms, and attack them with algorithms that give you an approximate answer instead<br />Each carefully-presented example includes helpful diagrams and fully-annotated code samples in Python. By the end of this book, you will know some of the most widely applicable algorithms as well as how and when to use them.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[In this third volume of his four-volume history of the modern world, as it has been produced by the development and expansion of the West, Eric Hobsbawm combines vast erudition with a graceful prose style to re-create the epoch that laid the basis for the twentieth century. “Though written by a professional historian,” Hobsbawm writes of his own work, “[it] is addressed not to other academics, but to all who wish to understand the world and who believe history is important for this purpose.”<br />—from the back cover]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[In the wake of the French Revolution &amp; the Industrial Revolution, Europe underwent another revolution--this time a revolution of values. The author examines the rise of industrial capitalism and the consolidation of bourgeois culture, exploring the effects of mounting concentration of wealth, population migrations, and the domination of European culture. Integrating economics with political and intellectual developments, this account studies the cycles of boom &amp; slump that characterize capitalist economies, of the victims &amp; victors of the bourgeois ethos.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[An elegant, witty, and engaging exploration of the riddle of time, which examines the consequences of Einstein's theory of relativity and offers startling suggestions about what recent research may reveal.<br />The eternal questions of science and religion were profoundly recast by Einstein's theory of relativity and its implications that time can be warped by motion and gravitation, and that it cannot be meaningfully divided into past, present, and future.<br />In About Time, Paul Davies discusses the big bang theory, chaos theory, and the recent discovery that the universe appears to be younger than some of the objects in it, concluding that Einstein's theory provides only an incomplete understanding of the nature of time. Davies explores unanswered questions such as:<br />* Does the universe have a beginning and an end?<br />* Is the passage of time merely an illusion?<br />* Is it possible to travel backward -- or forward -- in time?<br />About Time weaves physics and metaphysics in a provocative contemplation of time and the universe.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Quite simply, test-driven development is meant to eliminate fear in application development. While some fear is healthy (often viewed as a conscience that tells programmers to "be careful!"), the author believes that byproducts of fear include tentative, grumpy, and uncommunicative programmers who are unable to absorb constructive criticism. When programming teams buy into TDD, they immediately see positive results. They eliminate the fear involved in their jobs, and are better equipped to tackle the difficult challenges that face them. TDD eliminates tentative traits, it teaches programmers to communicate, and it encourages team members to seek out criticism However, even the author admits that grumpiness must be worked out individually! In short, the premise behind TDD is that code should be continually tested and refactored. Kent Beck teaches programmers by example, so they can painlessly and dramatically increase the quality of their work.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<blockquote>The decisiveness of the short period of colonialism and its negative consequences for Africa spring mainly from the fact that Africa lost power. Power is the ultimate determinant in human society, being basic to the relations within any group and between groups. It implies the ability to defend one's interests and if necessary to impose one’s will by any means available. In relations between peoples, the question of power determines maneuverability in bargaining, the extent to which a people survive as a physical and cultural entity. When one society finds itself forced to relinquish power entirely to another society, that in itself is a form of underdevelopment.</blockquote><br />Before a bomb ended his life in the summer of 1980, Walter Rodney had created a powerful legacy. This pivotal work, <em>How Europe Underdeveloped Africa</em>, had already brought a new perspective to the question of underdevelopment in Africa. his Marxist analysis went far beyond the heretofore accepted approach in the study of Third World underdevelopment. <em>How Europe Underdeveloped Africa</em> is an excellent introductory study for the student who wishes to better understand the dynamics of Africa’s contemporary relations with the West.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Abelson and Sussman's classic <i>Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</i> teaches readers how to program by employing the tools of abstraction and modularity. The authors' central philosophy is that programming is the task of breaking large problems into small ones. The book spends a great deal of time considering both this decomposition and the process of knitting the smaller pieces back together.<p> The authors employ this philosophy in their writing technique. The text asks the broad question "What is programming?" Having come to the conclusion that programming consists of procedures and data, the authors set off to explore the related questions of "What is data?" and "What is a procedure?"</p><p> The authors build up the simple notion of a procedure to dizzying complexity. The discussion culminates in the description of the code behind the programming language Scheme. The authors finish with examples of how to implement some of the book's concepts on a register machine. Through this journey, the reader not only learns how to program, but also how to think about programming.</p>]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Every day, more and more people want to learn some HTML and CSS. Joining the professional web designers and programmers are new audiences who need to know a little bit of code at work (update a content management system or e-commerce store) and those who want to make their personal blogs more attractive. Many books teaching HTML and CSS are dry and only written for those who want to become programmers, which is why this book takes an entirely new approach.<br /><br /> • Introduces HTML and CSS in a way that makes them accessible to everyone—hobbyists, students, and professionals—and it’s full-color throughout<br /><br /> • Utilizes information graphics and lifestyle photography to explain the topics in a simple way that is engaging<br /><br /> • Boasts a unique structure that allows you to progress through the chapters from beginning to end or just dip into topics of particular interest at your leisure<br /><br />This educational book is one that you will enjoy picking up, reading, then referring back to. It will make you wish other technical topics were presented in such a simple, attractive and engaging way!]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Get Rich or Get Lucky is a gripping fantasy thriller that follows Adam who finds himself in control of a magic he never knew existed.<br /><br />After a string of disappointments with his literary career, Adam decides to embark on a get-rich-quick scheme by renovating run-down houses. By chance he discovers a book of magic in the basement of a derelict property and he can’t believe his luck. Excited by his find, he invites his friends Dick and Charlie, to tell them about it. <br /><br />But things quickly take a turn for the worse when Adam inadvertently casts a spell which turns Dick into a crayfish. Adam is unable to reverse the spell immediately and while searching for the solution, leaves Dick in the garden pond, which gets flooded and Dick disappears. Dick's wife Rachael reports him missing and the police then accuse Adam of wrongdoing. Things continue to spiral out of control when Adam is burgled and the book gets stolen. He then discovers that a powerful, evil warlock is looking for the book. Adam finds himself in a race against time, to recover the book and thwart the warlock to stand any chance of bringing Dick back, if he can. <br /><br />From the author of the sci-fi adventure The Arbitrator, Get Rich or Get Lucky is a black humoured fantasy thriller that will have readers on the edge of their seats. It will appeal to readers who enjoy fantasy fiction, in addition to those who also enjoy fast-paced thrillers.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Today we think statistics are the enemy, numbers used to mislead and confuse us. That’s a mistake, Tim Harford says in The Data Detective. We shouldn’t be suspicious of statistics—we need to understand what they mean and how they can improve our lives: they are, at heart, human behavior seen through the prism of numbers and are often “the only way of grasping much of what is going on around us.” If we can toss aside our fears and learn to approach them clearly—understanding how our own preconceptions lead us astray—statistics can point to ways we can live better and work smarter.<br /><br />As “perhaps the best popular economics writer in the world” (New Statesman), Tim Harford is an expert at taking complicated ideas and untangling them for millions of readers. In The Data Detective, he uses new research in science and psychology to set out ten strategies for using statistics to erase our biases and replace them with new ideas that use virtues like patience, curiosity, and good sense to better understand ourselves and the world. As a result, The Data Detective is a big-idea book about statistics and human behavior that is fresh, unexpected, and insightful.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA["Eric Evans has written a fantastic book on how you can make the design of your software match your mental model of the problem domain you are addressing. "His book is very compatible with XP. It is not about drawing pictures of a domain; it is about how you think of it, the language you use to talk about it, and how you organize your software to reflect your improving understanding of it. Eric thinks that learning about your problem domain is as likely to happen at the end of your project as at the beginning, and so refactoring is a big part of his technique. "The book is a fun read. Eric has lots of interesting stories, and he has a way with words. I see this book as essential reading for software developers--it is a future classic." --<b>Ralph Johnson</b>, author of <i>Design Patterns</i> "If you don't think you are getting value from your investment in object-oriented programming, this book will tell you what you've forgotten to do. "Eric Evans convincingly argues for the importance of domain modeling as the central focus of development and provides a solid framework and set of techniques for accomplishing it. This is timeless wisdom, and will hold up long after the methodologies du jour have gone out of fashion." --<b>Dave Collins</b>, author of <i>Designing Object-Oriented User Interfaces </i> "Eric weaves real-world experience modeling--and building--business applications into a practical, useful book. Written from the perspective of a trusted practitioner, Eric's descriptions of ubiquitous language, the benefits of sharing models with users, object life-cycle management, logical and physical application structuring, and the process and results of deep refactoring are major contributions to our field." --<b>Luke Hohmann</b>, author of <i>Beyond Software Architecture </i> "This book belongs on the shelf of every thoughtful software developer." --<b>Kent Beck</b> "What Eric has managed to capture is a part of the design process that experienced object designers have always used, but that we have been singularly unsuccessful as a group in conveying to the rest of the industry. We've given away bits and pieces of this knowledge...but we've never organized and systematized the principles of building domain logic. This book is important." --<b>Kyle Brown</b>, author of <i>Enterprise Java(TM) Programming with IBM(R) WebSphere(R)</i> The software development community widely acknowledges that domain modeling is central to software design. Through domain models, software developers are able to express rich functionality and translate it into a software implementation that truly serves the needs of its users. But despite its obvious importance, there are few practical resources that explain how to incorporate effective domain modeling into the software development process. <b> <i>Domain-Driven Design</i> </b> fills that need. This is not a book about specific technologies. It offers readers a systematic approach to domain-driven design, presenting an extensive set of design best practices, experience-based techniques, and fundamental principles that facilitate the development of software projects facing complex domains. Intertwining design and development practice, this book incorporates numerous examples based on actual projects to illustrate the application of domain-driven design to real-world software development. Readers learn how to use a domain model to make a complex development effort more focused and dynamic. A core of best practices and standard patterns provides a common language for the development team. A shift in emphasis--refactoring not just the code but the model underlying the code--in combination with the frequent iterations of Agile development leads to deeper insight into domains and enhanced communication between domain expert and programmer. <b> <i>Domain-Driven Design</i> </b> then builds on this foundation, and addresses modeling and design for complex systems and larger organizations.Specific topics covered include:<br />Getting all team members to speak the same language Connecting model and implementation more deeply Sharpening key distinctions in a model Managing the lifecycle of a domain object Writing domain code that is safe to combine in elaborate ways Making complex code obvious and predictable Formulating a domain vision statement Distilling the core of a complex domain Digging out implicit concepts needed in the model Applying analysis patterns Relating design patterns to the model Maintaining model integrity in a large system Dealing with coexisting models on the same project Organizing systems with large-scale structures Recognizing and responding to modeling breakthroughs With this book in hand, object-oriented developers, system analysts, and designers will have the guidance they need to organize and focus their work, create rich and useful domain models, and leverage those models into quality, long-lasting software implementations.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<b>From the bestselling author of <i>Lab Girl </i>comes a slim, urgent missive on the defining issue of our time: here is Hope Jahren on climate change, our timeless pursuit of more, and how the same human ambition that got us here can also be our salvation. A Vintage Original.</b><br /><br />Hope Jahren is an award-winning geobiologist, a brilliant writer, and one of the seven billion people with whom we share this earth. <i>The Story of More </i>is her impassioned open letter to humanity as we stand at the crossroads of survival and extinction. Jahren celebrates the long history of our enterprising spirit--which has tamed wild crops, cured diseases, and sent us to the moon--but also shows how that spirit has created excesses that are quickly warming our planet to dangerous levels. In short, highly readable chapters, she takes us through the science behind the key inventions--from electric power to large-scale farming and automobiles--that, even as they help us, release untenable amounts of carbon dioxide. She explains the current and projected consequences of greenhouse gases--from superstorms to rising sea levels--and the science-based tools that could help us fight back. At once an explainer on the mechanisms of warming and a capsule history of human development, <i>The Story of More</i> illuminates the link between our consumption habits and our endangered earth, showing us how we can use less and share more. It is the essential pocket primer on climate change that will leave an indelible impact on everyone who reads it.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA["Nothing less than a full-scale assault on conventional economic wisdom."<br />—<i>Newsweek</i><br /><br /><b>One the 100 most influential books published since World War II</b><br />—<i>The Times Literary Supplement</i><br /><br />Hailed as an "eco-bible" by <i>Time</i> magazine, E.F. Schumacher's riveting, richly researched statement on sustainability has become more relevant and vital with each year since its initial groundbreaking publication during the 1973 energy crisis. A landmark statement against "bigger is better" industrialism, Schumacher's <i>Small Is Beautiful</i> paved the way for twenty-first century books on environmentalism and economics, like Jeffrey Sachs's <i>The End of Poverty</i>, Paul Hawken's <i>Natural Capitalism</i>, Mohammad Yunis's <i>Banker to the Poor</i>, and Bill McKibben's <i>Deep Economy</i>. This timely reissue offers a crucial message for the modern world struggling to balance economic growth with the human costs of globalization.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA['Globalisation' is the buzzword of the 1990s. VI Lenin's <i>Imperialism: The Highest Stage of Capitalism</i> was one of the first attempts to account for the increasing importance of the world market in the twentieth century. Originally published in 1916, <i>Imperialism</i> explains how colonialism and the First World War were inherent features of the global development of the capitalist economy.<br /><br />In a new introduction, Norman Lewis and James Malone contrast Lenin's approach with that adopted by contemporary theories of globalisation. They argue that, while much has changed since Lenin wrote, his theoretical framework remains the best method for understanding recent global developments.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[In 2554, the World is Coming to its End, unless an impossible mission through 600 years of time travel succeeds. Maternal instinct knows no boundaries, including the nano-neural-net intravenously installed in Dannia Weston's mind to repress her identity, allowing her to perform a mission 300 years before her time. Transported to the year 1954, Dannia becomes a woman with a mid-twentieth century persona, college educated with an aptitude for mechanical invention. Due to her work during the war, she is employed by the U.S. government on a secret project. But what no one knows-including Dannia or those who sent her back to tinker with the mechanical past to reduce future pollution-is what might happen should she become emotionally involved in 1954. The 2254 science team programmed the nano-net to prevent the possibility of pregnancy, but each person reacts to strong emotional stimuli differently, and using birth control not available in 1954 is out of the question. When Dannia falls in love with Peter Hersh and becomes pregnant, her hormones erode a small section of the nano-chained network that stabilizes her new identity, triggering a mild memory rebirth...and threatening her mission and the fate of the world.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[What do flashlights, the British invasion, black cats, and seesaws have to do with computers? In CODE, they show us the ingenious ways we manipulate language and invent new means of communicating with each other. And through CODE, we see how this ingenuity and our very human compulsion to communicate have driven the technological innovations of the past two centuries. <br /><br />Using everyday objects and familiar language systems such as Braille and Morse code, author Charles Petzold weaves an illuminating narrative for anyone who’s ever wondered about the secret inner life of computers and other smart machines. <br /><br />It’s a cleverly illustrated and eminently comprehensible story—and along the way, you’ll discover you’ve gained a real context for understanding today’s world of PCs, digital media, and the Internet. No matter what your level of technical savvy, CODE will charm you—and perhaps even awaken the technophile within.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[With nearly a million copies sold, Security Analysis has been continuously in print for more than sixty years. No investment book in history had either the immediate impact, or the long-term relevance and value, of its first edition in 1934. By 1951, seventeen years past its original publication and more than a decade beyond its revised and acclaimed 1940 second edition, authors Benjamin Graham and David Dodd had seen business and investment markets travel from the depths of Depression to the heights of recovery, and had observed investor behavior during both the calm of peacetime and the chaos of World War II. The prescient thinking and insight displayed by Graham and Dodd in the first two editions of Security Analysis reached new heights in the third edition. In words that could just as easily have been written today as fifty years ago, they detail techniques and strategies for attaining success as individual investors, as well as the responsibilities of corporate decision makers to build shareholder value and transparency for those investors. The focus of the book, however, remains its timeless guidance and advice--that careful analysis of balance sheets is the primary road to investment success, with all other considerations little more than distractions. The authors had seen and survived the Great Depression as well as the political and financial instabilities of World War II and were now better able to outline a program for sensible and profitable investing in the latter half of the century. Security The Classic 1951 Edition marks the return of this long-out-of-print work to the investment canon. It will reacquaint you with the foundations of value investing--more relevant than ever in tumultuous twenty-first century markets--and allow you to own the third installment in what has come to be regarded as the most accessible and usable title in the history of investment publishing.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[A dramatically new understanding of human history, challenging our most fundamental assumptions about social evolution—from the development of agriculture and cities to the origins of the state, democracy, and inequality—and revealing new possibilities for human emancipation.<br /><br />For generations, our remote ancestors have been cast as primitive and childlike—either free and equal innocents, or thuggish and warlike. Civilization, we are told, could be achieved only by sacrificing those original freedoms or, alternatively, by taming our baser instincts. David Graeber and David Wengrow show how such theories first emerged in the eighteenth century as a conservative reaction to powerful critiques of European society posed by Indigenous observers and intellectuals. Revisiting this encounter has startling implications for how we make sense of human history today, including the origins of farming, property, cities, democracy, slavery, and civilization itself.<br /><br />Drawing on pathbreaking research in archaeology and anthropology, the authors show how history becomes a far more interesting place once we learn to throw off our conceptual shackles and perceive what’s really there. If humans did not spend 95 percent of their evolutionary past in tiny bands of hunter-gatherers, what were they doing all that time? If agriculture, and cities, did not mean a plunge into hierarchy and domination, then what kinds of social and economic organization did they lead to? The answers are often unexpected, and suggest that the course of human history may be less set in stone, and more full of playful, hopeful possibilities, than we tend to assume.<br /><br />The Dawn of Everything fundamentally transforms our understanding of the human past and offers a path toward imagining new forms of freedom, new ways of organizing society. This is a monumental book of formidable intellectual range, animated by curiosity, moral vision, and a faith in the power of direct action.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Capturing a wealth of experience about the design of object-oriented software, four top-notch designers present a catalog of simple and succinct solutions to commonly occurring design problems. Previously undocumented, these 23 patterns allow designers to create more flexible, elegant, and ultimately reusable designs without having to rediscover the design solutions themselves.<br /><br />The authors begin by describing what patterns are and how they can help you design object-oriented software. They then go on to systematically name, explain, evaluate, and catalog recurring designs in object-oriented systems. With Design Patterns as your guide, you will learn how these important patterns fit into the software development process, and how you can leverage them to solve your own design problems most efficiently.<p> Each pattern describes the circumstances in which it is applicable, when it can be applied in view of other design constraints, and the consequences and trade-offs of using the pattern within a larger design. All patterns are compiled from real systems and are based on real-world examples. Each pattern also includes code that demonstrates how it may be implemented in object-oriented programming languages like C++ or Smalltalk.</p>]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Few books on software project management have been as influential and timeless as The Mythical Man-Month. With a blend of software engineering facts and thought-provoking opinions, Fred Brooks offers insight for anyone managing complex projects. These essays draw from his experience as project manager for the IBM System/360 computer family and then for OS/360, its massive software system. Now, 45 years after the initial publication of his book, Brooks has revisited his original ideas and added new thoughts and advice, both for readers already familiar with his work and for readers discovering it for the first time.<p>The added chapters contain (1) a crisp condensation of all the propositions asserted in the original book, including Brooks' central argument in The Mythical Man-Month: that large programming projects suffer management problems different from small ones due to the division of labor; that the conceptual integrity of the product is therefore critical; and that it is difficult but possible to achieve this unity; (2) Brooks' view of these propositions a generation later; (3) a reprint of his classic 1986 paper "No Silver Bullet"; and (4) today's thoughts on the 1986 assertion, "There will be no silver bullet within ten years."</p>]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<b>The ultimate one-stop vegetarian cookbook-from the author of the classic How to Cook Everything</b>Hailed as "a more hip Joy of Cooking" by the Washington Post, Mark Bittman's award-winning book <i>How to Cook Everything</i> has become the bible for a new generation of home cooks, and the series has more than 1 million copies in print. Now, with <i>How to Cook Everything: Vegetarian</i>, Bittman has written the definitive guide to meatless meals-a book that will appeal to everyone who wants to cook simple but delicious meatless dishes, from health-conscious omnivores to passionate vegetarians.<br /><br /><i>How to Cook Everything: Vegetarian</i> includes more than 2,000 recipes and variations-far more than any other vegetarian cookbook. As always, Bittman's recipes are refreshingly straightforward, resolutely unfussy, and unfailingly delicious-producing dishes that home cooks can prepare with ease and serve with confidence. The book covers the whole spectrum of meatless cooking-including salads, soups, eggs and dairy, vegetables and fruit, pasta, grains, legumes, tofu and other meat substitutes, breads, condiments, desserts, and beverages. Special icons identify recipes that can be made in 30 minutes or less and in advance, as well as those that are vegan. Illustrated throughout with handsome line illustrations and brimming with Bittman's lucid, opinionated advice on everything from selecting vegetables to preparing pad Thai, How to <i>Cook Everything: Vegetarian</i> truly makes meatless cooking more accessible than ever.<br /><br /><b>Praise for How to Cook Everything Vegetarian</b><br /><br />"Mark Bittman's category lock on definitive, massive food tomes continues with this well-thought-out ode to the garden and beyond. Combining deep research, tasty information, and delicious easy-to-cook recipes is Mark's forte and everything I want to cook is in here, from chickpea fries to cheese soufflés."<br />—Mario Batali, chef, author, and entrepreneur<br /><br />"How do you make an avid meat eater (like me) fall in love with vegetarian cooking? Make Mark Bittman's <i>How to Cook Everything Vegetarian</i> part of your culinary library."<br />—Bobby Flay, chef/owner of Mesa Grill and Bar Americain and author of the <i>Mesa Grill Cookbook</i><br /><br />"Recipes that taste this good aren't supposed to be so healthy. Mark Bittman makes being a vegetarian fun."<br />—Dr. Mehmet Oz, Professor of Surgery, New York-Presbyterian/Columbia Medical Center and coauthor of <i>You: The Owner's Manual</i>]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Harold McGee's <i>On Food and Cooking</i> is a kitchen classic. Hailed by <i>Time</i> magazine as "a minor masterpiece" when it first appeared in 1984, <i>On Food and Cooking</i> is the bible to which food lovers and professional chefs worldwide turn for an understanding of where our foods come from, what exactly they're made of, and how cooking transforms them into something new and delicious. Now, for its twentieth anniversary, Harold McGee has prepared a new, fully revised and updated edition of <i>On Food and Cooking.</i> He has rewritten the text almost completely, expanded it by two-thirds, and commissioned more than 100 new illustrations. As compulsively readable and engaging as ever, the new <i>On Food and Cooking</i> provides countless eye-opening insights into food, its preparation, and its enjoyment.<br /><br /><i>On Food and Cooking</i> pioneered the translation of technical food science into cook-friendly kitchen science and helped give birth to the inventive culinary movement known as "molecular gastronomy." Though other books have now been written about kitchen science, <i>On Food and Cooking</i> remains unmatched in the accuracy, clarity, and thoroughness of its explanations, and the intriguing way in which it blends science with the historical evolution of foods and cooking techniques.<br /><br />Among the major themes addressed throughout this new edition are:<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Traditional and modern methods of food production and their influences on food quality<br />The great diversity of methods by which people in different places and times have prepared the same ingredients<br />Tips for selecting the best ingredients and preparing them successfully<br />The particular substances that give foods their flavors and that give us pleasure<br />Our evolving knowledge of the health benefits and risks of foods<br /><i>On Food and Cooking</i> is an invaluable and monumental compendium of basic information about ingredients, cooking methods, and the pleasures of eating. It will delight and fascinate anyone who has ever cooked, savored, or wondered about food.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Tim Ferriss, the #1 New York Times best-selling author of The 4-Hour Workweek, shares the ultimate choose-your-own-adventure book—a compilation of tools, tactics, and habits from 130+ of the world's top performers. From iconic entrepreneurs to elite athletes, from artists to billionaire investors, their short profiles can help you answer life's most challenging questions, achieve extraordinary results, and transform your life.<br /><br />From the author:<br /><br />In 2017, several of my close friends died in rapid succession. It was a very hard year, as it was for many people.<br /><br />It was also a stark reminder that time is our scarcest, non-renewable resource.<br /><br />With a renewed sense of urgency, I began asking myself many questions:<br /><br />Were my goals my own, or simply what I thought I should want?<br />How much of life had I missed from underplanning or overplanning?<br />How could I be kinder to myself?<br />How could I better say “no” to the trivial many to better say “yes” to the critical few?<br />How could I best reassess my priorities and my purpose in this world?<br /><br />To find answers, I reached out to the most impressive world-class performers in the world, ranging from wunderkinds in their 20s to icons in their 70s and 80s. No stone was left unturned.<br /><br />This book contains their answers—practical and tactical advice from mentors who have found solutions. Whether you want to 10x your results, get unstuck, or reinvent yourself, someone else has traveled a similar path and taken notes.<br /><br />This book, Tribe of Mentors, includes many of the people I grew up viewing as idols or demi-gods. Less than 10% have been on my podcast (The Tim Ferriss Show, more than 200 million downloads), making this a brand-new playbook of playbooks.<br /><br />No matter your challenge or opportunity, something in these pages can help.<br /><br />Among other things, you will learn:<br /><br />• More than 50 morning routines—both for the early riser and those who struggle to get out of bed.<br />• How TED curator Chris Anderson realized that the best way to get things done is to let go.<br />• The best purchases of $100 or less (you'll never have to think about the right gift again).<br />• How to overcome failure and bounce back towards success.<br />• Why Humans of New York creator Brandon Stanton believes that the best art will always be the riskiest.<br />• How to meditate and be more mindful (and not just for those that find it easy).<br />• Why tennis champion Maria Sharapova believe that “losing makes you think in ways victories can’t.”<br />• How to truly achieve work-life balance (and why most people tell you it isn’t realistic).<br />• How billionaire Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz transformed the way he engages with difficult situations to reduce suffering.<br />• Ways to thrive (and survive) the overwhelming amount of information you process every day.<br />• How to achieve clarity on your purpose and assess your priorities.<br />• And much more.<br /><br />This reference book, which I wrote for myself, has already changed my life. I certainly hope the same for you.<br /><br />I wish you luck as you forge your own path.<br /><br />All the best,<br /><br />Tim Ferriss]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Is the financial plan of mediocrity-a dream-stealing, soul-sucking dogma known as The Slowlane-your plan for creating wealth? You know how it goes-go to school, get a good job, save 10 percent of your paycheck, buy a used car, cancel the movie channels, quit drinking expensive Starbucks mocha lattes, save and penny-pinch your life away, trust your life-savings to the stock market, and one day you can retire rich. The mainstream financial gurus have sold you blindly down the river. For those who don't want a lifetime subscription to "settle for less," and a slight chance of elderly riches, there is an expressway to extraordinary wealth that can burn a trail to financial independence faster than any road out there. Demand the Fastlane, an alternative road to wealth that actually ignites dreams and creates millionaires young, not old. Hit the Fastlane, crack the code to wealth, and find out how to live rich for a lifetime.]]></book_description>
